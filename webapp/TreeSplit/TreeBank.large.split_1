All/PDT this/DT illustrates/VBZ that/IN Japanese/JJ ministries/NNS still/RB have/VBP a/DT ``/`` provider/NN ''/'' mentality/NN ;/: they/PP do/VBP not/RB serve/VB the/DT people/NNS ,/, and/CC particularly/RB not/RB consumers/NNS ./.

Japan/NP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT political/JJ country/NN ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ a/DT bureaucratic/JJ country/NN ./. 
The/DT Diet/NP plays/VBZ a/DT minor/JJ role/NN compared/VBN with/IN the/DT powerful/JJ bureaucratic/JJ system/NN ./. 
Most/JJS bills/NNS are/VBP drafted/VBN by/IN bureaucrats/NNS ,/, not/RB politicians/NNS ./. 
The/DT Diet/NP does/VBZ n't/RB normally/RB even/VB debate/VB bills/NNS because/IN the/DT opposition/NN parties/NNS are/VBP so/RB often/RB opposed/VBN to/TO whatever/WDT LDP/NP does/VBZ that/IN it/PP would/MD be/VB a/DT waste/NN of/IN time/NN ./.

A/DT recent/JJ example/NN is/VBZ the/DT 3/CD %/NN consumption/NN tax/NN on/IN all/DT commercial/JJ activities/NNS ./. 
This/DT makes/VBZ enormous/JJ sense/NN in/IN Japan/NP ,/, where/WRB direct/JJ tax/NN accounts/VBZ for/IN more/JJR than/IN 70/CD %/NN of/IN revenues/NNS and/CC the/DT capture/NN rate/NN of/IN direct/JJ tax/NN is/VBZ so/RB unfair/JJ ./.

If/IN you/PP are/VBP a/DT retailer/NN ,/, 50/CD %/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT farmer/NN ,/, 30/CD %/NN ./. 
To/TO correct/VB this/DT inequality/NN ,/, most/JJS people/NNS would/MD have/VB favored/VBN an/DT indirect/JJ tax/NN ,/, like/IN the/DT consumption/NN tax/NN ./. 
But/CC the/DT bill/NN was/VBD passed/VBN without/IN debate/NN in/IN the/DT Diet/NP ,/, in/IN the/DT absence/NN of/IN the/DT opposition/NN ./.

Use/VB credit/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT operation/NN of/IN capital/NN markets/NNS ,/, not/RB to/TO provide/VB subsidies/NNS ./. 
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ conflict/NN between/IN providing/VBG a/DT subsidy/NN and/CC maintaining/VBG the/DT integrity/NN of/IN a/DT credit/NN program/NN ./. 
If/IN the/DT program/NN is/VBZ meant/VBN to/TO provide/VB a/DT subsidy/NN ,/, collecting/VBG the/DT debt/NN defeats/VBZ the/DT original/JJ goal/NN ./. 
Thus/RB ,/, subsidized/JJ loans/NNS tend/VBP to/TO turn/VB into/IN giveaway/JJ programs/NNS ,/, with/IN increasing/VBG subsidy/NN and/CC default/NN rates/NNS over/IN time/NN ./. 
To/TO avoid/VB this/DT problem/NN ,/, government/NN should/MD issue/VB credit/NN only/RB if/IN it/PP intends/VBZ to/TO use/VB every/DT legal/JJ method/NN to/TO collect/VB ./. 
In/IN contrast/NN ,/, credit/NN programs/NNS can/MD be/VB appropriate/JJ tools/NNS to/TO improve/VB the/DT operation/NN of/IN capital/NN markets/NNS ./. 
For/IN example/NN ,/, legal/JJ restrictions/NNS on/IN interstate/JJ banking/NN once/RB inhibited/VBD the/DT supply/NN of/IN credit/NN to/TO the/DT agricultural/JJ sector/NN ./. 
Farm/NN lending/NN was/VBD enacted/VBN to/TO correct/VB this/DT problem/NN by/IN providing/VBG a/DT reliable/JJ flow/NN of/IN lendable/JJ funds/NNS ./. 
However/RB ,/, this/DT in/IN no/DT way/NN justifies/VBZ the/DT huge/JJ government/NN subsidies/NNS and/CC losses/NNS on/IN such/JJ loans/NNS ./. 
Credit/NN policy/NN should/MD separate/VB these/DT two/CD competing/VBG objectives/NNS and/CC eliminate/VB aspects/NNS that/WDT provide/VBP the/DT subsidy/NN ./. 
For/IN example/NN ,/, student/NN loans/NNS currently/RB attempt/VBP to/TO subsidize/VB college/NN attendance/NN and/CC mitigate/VB problems/NNS created/VBN by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN students/NNS '/POS future/JJ earnings/NNS are/VBP not/RB accepted/VBN as/IN collateral/NN ./. 
The/DT program/NN provides/VBZ highly/RB subsidized/JJ loans/NNS to/TO any/DT student/NN whose/WP$ family/NN earns/VBZ less/JJR than/IN a/DT particular/JJ amount/NN ./. 
High/JJ default/NN rates/NNS ,/, a/DT low/JJ interest/NN rate/NN ,/, and/CC government/NN coverage/NN of/IN all/DT interest/NN costs/NNS while/IN the/DT student/NN is/VBZ in/IN school/NN make/VBP program/NN costs/NNS extremely/RB high/JJ ./. 
Families/NNS that/WDT do/VBP not/RB need/VB the/DT loan/NN can/MD make/VB money/NN simply/RB by/IN putting/VBG the/DT loan/NN in/IN the/DT bank/NN and/CC paying/VBG it/PP back/RP when/WRB the/DT student/NN graduates/VBZ ./. 
In/IN contrast/NN ,/, a/DT student/NN loan/NN program/NN that/WDT was/VBD meant/VBN solely/RB to/TO correct/VB capital-market/JJ imperfections/NNS would/MD allow/VB loans/NNS for/IN any/DT student/NN ,/, regardless/RB of/IN family/NN income/NN ,/, at/IN market/NN or/CC near-market/JJ rates/NNS ./. 
While/IN the/DT student/NN was/VBD in/IN school/NN ,/, interest/NN costs/NNS would/MD either/RB be/VB paid/VBN by/IN the/DT student/NN or/CC added/VBN to/TO the/DT loan/NN balance/NN ./. 
This/DT program/NN ,/, combined/VBN with/IN cash/NN grants/NNS to/TO needy/JJ students/NNS ,/, would/MD reduce/VB program/NN costs/NNS and/CC much/RB more/RBR effectively/RB target/VB the/DT intended/JJ beneficiaries/NNS ./. 
2/LS ./. 
Provide/VB better/JJR incentives/NNS ./. 
Given/VBN the/DT structure/NN of/IN most/JJS credit/NN programs/NNS ,/, it/PP is/VBZ surprising/JJ that/IN default/NN rates/NNS are/VBP not/RB even/RB higher/JJR ./. 
Guarantee/NN rates/NNS are/VBP typically/RB 100/CD %/NN ,/, giving/VBG lenders/NNS little/JJ reason/NN to/TO screen/NN customers/NNS carefully/RB ./. 
Reducing/VBG those/DT rates/NNS moderately/RB (/( say/UH ,/, to/TO 75/CD %/NN )/) would/MD still/RB provide/VB substantial/JJ assistance/NN to/TO borrowers/NNS ./. 
But/CC it/PP would/MD also/RB encourage/VB lenders/NNS to/TO choose/VB more/RBR creditworthy/NN customers/NNS ,/, and/CC go/VB a/DT long/JJ way/NN toward/IN reducing/VBG defaults/NNS ./. 
For/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT Small/NP Business/NP Administration/NP has/VBZ had/VBD reasonable/JJ success/NN in/IN reducing/VBG both/DT guarantee/NN rates/NNS and/CC default/NN rates/NNS in/IN its/PP$ Preferred/NP Lenders/NP '/POS Program/NP ./. 
Borrowers/NNS '/POS incentives/NNS are/VBP equally/RB skewed/JJ ./. 
Since/IN the/DT government/NN has/VBZ a/DT dismal/JJ record/NN of/IN collecting/VBG bad/JJ debts/NNS ,/, the/DT costs/NNS to/TO the/DT borrower/NN of/IN defaulting/VBG are/VBP usually/RB low/JJ ./. 
In/IN addition/NN ,/, it/PP is/VBZ often/RB possible/JJ to/TO obtain/VB a/DT new/JJ government/NN loan/NN even/RB if/IN existing/JJ debts/NNS are/VBP not/RB paid/VBN off/RP ./. 
Simple/NN policy/NN prescriptions/NNS in/IN this/DT case/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO improve/VB debt/NN collection/NN (/( taking/VBG the/DT gloves/NNS off/RP contracted/VBN collection/NN agencies/NNS )/) and/CC to/TO deny/VB new/JJ credit/NN to/TO defaulters/NNS ./. 
These/DT provisions/NNS would/MD be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO enforce/VB for/IN a/DT program/NN intended/VBN to/TO provide/VB a/DT subsidy/NN ,/, but/CC would/MD be/VB reasonable/JJ and/CC effective/JJ devices/NNS for/IN programs/NNS that/WDT attempt/VBP to/TO offset/VB market/NN imperfections/NNS ./. 
3/LS ./. 
Record/VB the/DT true/JJ costs/NNS of/IN credit/NN programs/NNS in/IN the/DT federal/JJ budget/NN ./. 
Since/IN the/DT budget/NN measures/VBZ cash/NN flow/NN ,/, a/DT new/JJ $/$ 1/CD direct/JJ loan/NN is/VBZ treated/VBN as/IN a/DT $/$ 1/CD expenditure/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN at/IN least/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT loan/NN will/MD be/VB paid/VBN back/RP ./. 
Loan/NN guarantees/NNS do/VBP n't/RB appear/VB at/IN all/DT until/IN the/DT borrower/NN defaults/NNS ,/, so/RB new/JJ guarantees/NNS do/VBP not/RB raise/VB the/DT deficit/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN they/PP create/VBP future/JJ liabilities/NNS for/IN the/DT government/NN ./. 
By/IN converting/VBG an/DT expenditure/NN or/CC loan/NN to/TO a/DT guarantee/NN ,/, the/DT government/NN can/MD ensure/VB the/DT same/JJ flow/NN of/IN resources/NNS and/CC reduce/VB the/DT current/JJ deficit/NN ./. 
Predictably/RB ,/, guarantees/NNS outstanding/JJ have/VBP risen/VBN by/IN $/$ 130/CD billion/CD since/IN 1985/CD ,/, while/IN direct/JJ loans/NNS outstanding/JJ have/VBP fallen/VBN by/IN $/$ 30/CD billion/CD ./. 
The/DT true/JJ budgetary/JJ cost/NN of/IN a/DT credit/NN subsidy/NN is/VBZ the/DT discounted/JJ value/NN of/IN the/DT net/JJ costs/NNS to/TO government/NN ./. 
This/DT figure/NN could/MD be/VB estimated/VBN using/VBG techniques/NNS employed/VBN by/IN private/JJ lenders/NNS to/TO forecast/VB losses/NNS ,/, or/CC determined/VBN by/IN selling/VBG loans/NNS to/TO private/JJ owners/NNS (/( without/IN federal/JJ guarantees/NNS )/) ./. 
Neither/DT technique/NN is/VBZ perfect/JJ ,/, but/CC both/DT are/VBP better/JJR than/IN the/DT current/JJ system/NN ,/, which/WDT misstates/VBZ the/DT costs/NNS of/IN new/JJ credit/NN programs/NNS by/IN amounts/NNS that/WDT vary/VBP substantially/RB and/CC average/VBP about/RB $/$ 20/CD billion/CD annually/RB ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT Congressional/NP Budget/NP Office/NP ./. 
A/DT budget/NN that/WDT reflected/VBD the/DT real/JJ costs/NNS of/IN lending/NN would/MD eliminate/VB incentives/NNS to/TO convert/VB spending/NN or/CC lending/NN programs/NNS to/TO guarantees/NNS and/CC would/MD let/VB taxpayers/NNS know/VB what/WP Congress/NP is/VBZ committing/VBG them/PP to/TO ./.

The/DT article/NN is/VBZ ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, replete/JJ with/IN outrageous/JJ distortions/NNS ./. 
One/CD of/IN Mr./NP Roberts/NP 's/POS observations/NNS is/VBZ that/IN the/DT Bank/NP 's/POS own/JJ loan/NN portfolio/NN is/VBZ in/IN deep/JJ trouble/NN because/IN of/IN its/PP$ lending/NN to/TO developing/VBG countries/NNS ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ just/RB not/RB so/RB ./. 
The/DT reality/NN is/VBZ that/IN Bank/NP finances/NNS are/VBP rock/NN solid/JJ ./. 
As/IN of/IN June/NP 30/CD ,/, 1989/CD --/: the/DT day/NN our/PP$ past/NN fiscal/JJ year/NN came/VBD to/TO a/DT close/NN --/: only/RB 4.1/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT Bank/NP 's/POS portfolio/NN was/VBD affected/VBN by/IN arrears/NNS of/IN over/IN six/CD months/NNS ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ an/DT enviably/RB low/JJ level/NN ./. 
Moreover/RB ,/, the/DT Bank/NP follows/VBZ a/DT prudent/JJ provisioning/VBG policy/NN and/CC has/VBZ set/VBN aside/RB $/$ 800/CD million/CD against/IN possible/JJ loan/NN losses/NNS ./. 
For/IN the/DT same/JJ fiscal/JJ year/NN ,/, by/IN the/DT way/NN ,/, the/DT Bank/NP 's/POS net/JJ income/NN was/VBD a/DT robust/JJ $/$ 1.1/CD billion/CD after/IN provisions/NNS ./.

''/'' Here/RB ,/, too/RB ,/, Mr./NP Roberts/NP is/VBZ way/NN off/IN the/DT mark/NN ./. 
The/DT reality/NN is/VBZ that/IN Bank/NP loans/NNS have/VBP been/VBN linked/VBN to/TO policy/NN improvements/NNS for/IN 40/CD years/NNS ./. 
Our/PP$ traditional/JJ project/NN loans/NNS have/VBP ,/, for/IN instance/NN ,/, supported/VBN sensible/JJ energy/NN pricing/NN in/IN the/DT power/NN sector/NN ,/, sound/JJ interest-rate/JJ policies/NNS in/IN the/DT credit/NN area/NN and/CC the/DT operation/NN of/IN public/JJ utilities/NNS as/IN efficient/JJ ,/, autonomous/JJ agencies/NNS ./.

The/DT Bank/NP has/VBZ been/VBN making/VBG adjustment/NN loans/NNS for/IN 10/CD years/NNS ./. 
As/IN their/PP$ name/NN implies/VBZ ,/, these/DT operations/NNS are/VBP linked/VBN to/TO far-reaching/JJ policy/NN reforms/NNS that/WDT aim/VBP at/IN helping/VBG borrowing/NN countries/NNS get/VB back/RB on/IN the/DT growth/NN path/NN and/CC at/IN enhancing/VBG their/PP$ credit-worthiness/NN ./.

It/PP allowed/VBD Mr./NP Kasparov/NP to/TO exchange/VB his/PP$ dark-squared/JJ bishop/NN for/IN one/CD of/IN D.T./NP 's/POS knights/NNS ./. 
Bishops/NNS usually/RB are/VBP worth/JJ slightly/RB more/JJR than/IN knights/NNS ,/, but/CC in/IN this/DT case/NN Mr./NP Kasparov/NP was/VBD left/VBN with/IN a/DT very/RB dangerous/JJ knight/NN and/CC D.T./NP 's/POS surviving/VBG bishop/NN was/VBD reduced/VBN to/TO passivity/NN ./.

As/RB early/RB as/IN move/NN six/CD ,/, Mr./NP Kasparov/NP deviated/VBD from/IN a/DT well-known/JJ sequence/NN of/IN moves/NNS ,/, developing/VBG a/DT knight/NN instead/RB of/IN making/VBG a/DT standard/JJ bishop/NN attack/NN against/IN the/DT computer/NN 's/POS advanced/VBN knight/NN ./.

''/'' A/DT comprehensive/JJ development/NN policy/NN for/IN governors/NNS over/IN 30/CD would/MD seem/VB to/TO be/VB a/DT more/RBR pressing/JJ need/NN ./. 
What/WP Gov./NP Clinton/NP is/VBZ advocating/VBG ,/, in/IN effect/NN ,/, is/VBZ extending/VBG the/DT educational/JJ system/NN down/IN to/TO the/DT pre-kindergarten/NN years/NNS ./. 
Whether/IN desirable/JJ or/CC not/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT child-care/JJ program/NN ,/, not/RB an/DT educational/JJ program/NN ./. 
We/PP know/VBP that/IN very/RB early/JJ exposure/NN to/TO schooling/NN improves/VBZ performance/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ grade/NN ,/, but/CC afterward/RB the/DT difference/NN is/VBZ quickly/RB washed/VBN away/RB ./. 
Let/VB us/PP sum/VB up/IN what/WP we/PP do/VBP know/VB about/IN education/NN and/CC about/IN those/DT education/NN reforms/NNS that/WDT do/VBP work/VB and/CC do/VBP n't/RB work/VB :/: --/: ``/`` Parental/JJ involvement/NN ''/'' is/VBZ a/DT bad/JJ idea/NN ./. 
Parents/NNS are/VBP too/RB likely/JJ to/TO blame/VB schools/NNS for/IN the/DT educational/JJ limitations/NNS of/IN their/PP$ children/NNS ./. 
Parents/NNS should/MD be/VB involved/VBN with/IN their/PP$ children/NNS 's/POS education/NN at/IN home/NN ,/, not/RB in/IN school/NN ./.

If/IN parents/NNS are/VBP dissatisfied/VBN with/IN a/DT school/NN ,/, they/PP should/MD have/VB the/DT option/NN of/IN switching/VBG to/TO another/DT ./. 
--/: ``/`` Community/NN involvement/NN ''/'' is/VBZ an/DT even/RB worse/JJR idea/NN ./. 
Here/RB ,/, the/DT experience/NN of/IN New/NP York/NP City/NP is/VBZ decisive/JJ ./. 
Locally/RB elected/VBN school/NN boards/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN our/PP$ larger/JJR cities/NNS ,/, become/VBP the/DT prey/NN of/IN ambitious/JJ ,/, generally/RB corrupt/JJ ,/, and/CC invariably/RB demagogic/JJ local/JJ politicians/NNS or/CC would-be/JJ politicians/NNS ./. 
New/NP York/NP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN trying/VBG to/TO disengage/VB itself/PP from/IN a/DT 20-year-old/JJ commitment/NN to/TO this/DT system/NN of/IN school/NN governance/NN ,/, even/RB as/IN Chicago/NP and/CC other/JJ cities/NNS are/VBP moving/VBG to/TO institute/VB it/PP ./.

The/DT reason/NN is/VBZ simple/JJ :/: Education/NN takes/VBZ place/NN in/IN the/DT classroom/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT influence/NN of/IN money/NN is/VBZ minimal/JJ ./. 
Decades/NNS of/IN educational/JJ research/NN tell/VBP us/PP unequivocally/RB that/IN even/RB smaller/JJR classes/NNS have/VBP zero/CD effect/NN on/IN the/DT academic/JJ performance/NN of/IN the/DT pupils/NNS --/: though/IN they/PP may/MD sometimes/RB be/VB desirable/JJ for/IN other/JJ reasons/NNS ./.

There/EX is/VBZ neither/DT mystery/NN nor/CC paradox/NN in/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN as/IN educational/JJ expenditures/NNS (/( in/IN real/JJ terms/NNS )/) have/VBP increased/VBN sharply/RB in/IN the/DT past/NN quarter-of-a-century/JJ --/: we/PP now/RB spend/VBP more/RBR per/IN pupil/NN than/IN any/DT other/JJ country/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN --/: educational/JJ performance/NN has/VBZ declined/VBN ./. 
That/DT is/VBZ the/DT way/NN the/DT system/NN works/VBZ ./. 
--/: Students/NNS should/MD move/VB up/IN the/DT educational/JJ ladder/NN as/IN their/PP$ academic/JJ potential/NN allows/VBZ ./.

The/DT first/JJ of/IN three/CD major/JJ sources/NNS of/IN error/NN is/VBZ the/DT use/NN of/IN labor/NN input/NN estimates/NNS (/( mainly/RB employment/NN or/CC hours/NNS )/) instead/RB of/IN output/NN estimates/NNS for/IN those/DT sectors/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN governments/NNS ,/, paid/VBN household/NN services/NNS and/CC private/JJ non-profit/JJ institutions/NNS ,/, where/WRB there/EX are/VBP difficulties/NNS in/IN assembling/VBG output/NN data/NNS ./.

The/DT sale/NN and/CC spinoff/NN of/IN the/DT real/JJ estate/NN unit/NN is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ phase/NN of/IN what/WP could/MD lead/VB to/TO the/DT breakup/NN of/IN Santa/NP Fe/NP Pacific/NP into/IN free-standing/JJ companies/NNS for/IN its/PP$ railroad/NN and/CC energy/NN operations/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN real/JJ estate/NN ./. 
The/DT debt-laden/JJ parent/NN has/VBZ been/VBN under/IN pressure/NN from/IN large/JJ shareholders/NNS to/TO boost/VB the/DT company/NN 's/POS share/NN price/NN ./. 
At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN it/PP has/VBZ been/VBN caught/VBN in/IN an/DT earnings/NNS squeeze/NN ./. 
The/DT California/NP pension/NN fund/NN 's/POS planned/JJ investment/NN in/IN the/DT real/JJ estate/NN unit/NN is/VBZ unusual/JJ ./. 
Pension/NN funds/NNS rarely/RB own/VBP as/RB much/JJ as/IN a/DT 20/CD %/NN stake/NN in/IN what/WP is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT publicly/RB traded/VBN company/NN ./.

But/CC fund/NN officials/NNS said/VBD the/DT Santa/NP Fe/NP Pacific/NP Realty/NP investment/NN provides/VBZ an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO buy/VB a/DT stake/NN in/IN a/DT large/JJ real/JJ estate/NN portfolio/NN heavily/RB weighted/VBN with/IN California/NP properties/NNS ./.

The/DT purpose/NN of/IN the/DT note/NN is/VBZ to/TO provide/VB added/JJ capital/NN for/IN the/DT spun-off/JJ company/NN in/IN a/DT form/NN that/WDT will/MD save/VB it/PP spending/VBG cash/NN on/IN immediate/JJ interest/NN payments/NNS ,/, Mr./NP Roulac/NP said/VBD ./.

Real/JJ estate/NN operating/NN income/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ nine/CD months/NNS fell/VBD to/TO $/$ 71.9/CD million/CD from/IN $/$ 143/CD million/CD a/DT year/NN earlier/RBR ,/, the/DT company/NN said/VBD ./.

The/DT realty/NN unit/NN might/MD take/VB on/RP new/JJ debt/NN or/CC obtain/VB additional/JJ investors/NNS ,/, among/IN other/JJ possibilities/NNS ./. 
The/DT Santa/NP Fe/NP Pacific/NP spokesman/NN declined/VBD to/TO comment/VB on/IN that/DT aspect/NN ,/, saying/VBG the/DT deal/NN was/VBD still/RB under/IN negotiation/NN ./.

It/PP also/RB holds/VBZ nearly/RB 40,000/CD acres/NNS of/IN raw/JJ land/NN with/IN development/NN potential/NN ,/, but/CC under/IN a/DT previously/RB announced/VBN strategy/NN ,/, the/DT company/NN has/VBZ targeted/VBN building/NN on/IN 5,400/CD acres/NNS in/IN California/NP ,/, Arizona/NP and/CC the/DT Chicago/NP area/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ two/CD GAF/NP trials/NNS were/VBD watched/VBN closely/RB on/IN Wall/NP Street/NP because/IN they/PP were/VBD considered/VBN to/TO be/VB important/JJ tests/NNS of/IN the/DT government/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO convince/VB a/DT jury/NN of/IN allegations/NNS stemming/VBG from/IN its/PP$ insider-trading/NN investigations/NNS ./.

The/DT government/NN 's/POS credibility/NN in/IN the/DT GAF/NP case/NN depended/VBD heavily/RB on/IN its/PP$ star/JJ witness/NN ,/, Boyd/NP L./NP Jefferies/NP ,/, the/DT former/JJ Los/NP Angeles/NP brokerage/NN chief/NN who/WP was/VBD implicated/VBN by/IN former/JJ arbitrager/NN Ivan/NP Boesky/NP ,/, and/CC then/RB pointed/VBD the/DT finger/NN at/IN Mr./NP Sherwin/NP ,/, takeover/NN speculator/NN Salim/NP B./NP Lewis/NP and/CC corporate/JJ raider/NN Paul/NP Bilzerian/NP ./.

But/CC GAF/NP 's/POS bellwether/JJ role/NN was/VBD short-lived/JJ ./. 
The/DT first/JJ GAF/NP trial/NN ended/VBD in/IN a/DT mistrial/NN after/IN four/CD weeks/NNS when/WRB U.S./NP District/NP Judge/NP Mary/NP Johnson/NP Lowe/NP found/VBD that/IN a/DT prosecutor/NN improperly/RB ,/, but/CC unintentionally/RB ,/, withheld/VBD a/DT document/NN ./.

In/IN August/NP ,/, Mr./NP Lewis/NP pleaded/VBD guilty/JJ to/TO three/CD felony/NN counts/NNS ./. 
Nevertheless/RB ,/, the/DT stakes/NNS are/VBP still/RB high/JJ for/IN the/DT players/NNS directly/RB involved/VBN in/IN the/DT GAF/NP case/NN ./. 
The/DT mistrials/NNS have/VBP left/VBN the/DT reputations/NNS of/IN GAF/NP ,/, Mr./NP Sherwin/NP and/CC GAF/NP Chairman/NP Samuel/NP Heyman/NP in/IN limbo/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, China/NP would/MD still/RB finish/VB the/DT year/NN with/IN a/DT current-account/JJ deficit/NN of/IN $/$ 8.7/CD billion/CD ,/, based/VBN on/IN projections/NNS that/IN imports/NNS for/IN all/DT of/IN this/DT year/NN grow/VBP 20/CD %/NN and/CC exports/VBZ 10/CD %/NN ./. 
If/IN China/NP were/VBD still/RB on/IN good/JJ terms/NNS with/IN foreign/JJ lenders/NNS ,/, it/PP might/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO stem/VB the/DT drain/NN on/IN its/PP$ foreign-exchange/JJ reserves/NNS by/IN using/VBG some/DT loan/NN funds/NNS to/TO offset/VB the/DT current-account/JJ deficit/NN ./.

Last/JJ year/NN ,/, a/DT federal/JJ appeals/NNS court/NN in/IN St./NP Louis/NP said/VBD the/DT preamble/NN was/VBD unconstitutional/JJ ,/, citing/VBG an/DT earlier/JJR Supreme/NP Court/NP ruling/NN that/IN states/NNS ca/MD n't/RB justify/VB stricter/JJR abortion/NN curbs/NNS by/IN changing/VBG the/DT definition/NN of/IN when/WRB life/NN begins/VBZ ./.

''/'' Underclass/JJ neighborhoods/NNS offer/VBP relatively/RB few/JJ employment/NN opportunities/NNS ,/, contributing/VBG to/TO the/DT poverty/NN of/IN local/JJ residents/NNS ./.

Few/JJ small/JJ neighborhood/NN businesses/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, can/MD afford/VB such/JJ protection/NN ,/, even/RB in/IN collaboration/NN with/IN other/JJ local/JJ merchants/NNS ./. 
In/IN the/DT neighborhoods/NNS with/IN the/DT highest/JJS crime/NN rates/NNS ,/, small/JJ business/NN generally/RB relies/VBZ on/IN the/DT public/JJ police/NN force/NN for/IN protection/NN ./. 
This/DT creates/VBZ several/JJ problems/NNS ./. 
One/CD is/VBZ that/IN there/EX are/VBP not/RB enough/JJ police/NN to/TO satisfy/VB small/JJ businesses/NNS ./. 
The/DT number/NN one/CD proposal/NN for/IN reducing/VBG crime/NN in/IN the/DT New/NP York/NP survey/NN was/VBD to/TO put/VB more/JJR police/NNS on/IN foot/NN or/CC scooter/NN patrol/NN ,/, suggested/VBN by/IN more/JJR than/IN two-thirds/NNS of/IN the/DT respondents/NNS ./. 
Only/RB 22/CD %/NN supported/VBD private/JJ security/NN patrols/NNS funded/VBN by/IN the/DT merchants/NNS themselves/PP ./. 
A/DT second/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ the/DT persistent/JJ frustration/NN of/IN false/JJ alarms/NNS ,/, which/WDT can/MD make/VB urban/JJ police/NNS less/RBR than/IN enthusiastic/JJ about/IN responding/VBG to/TO calls/NNS from/IN small/JJ businesses/NNS ./. 
Only/RB half/PDT the/DT New/NP York/NP small/JJ businesses/NNS surveyed/VBN ,/, for/IN their/PP$ part/NN ,/, are/VBP satisfied/JJ with/IN the/DT police/NN response/NN they/PP receive/VBP ./. 
Some/DT cities/NNS ,/, including/VBG New/NP York/NP ,/, have/VBP experimented/VBN with/IN special/JJ tax/NN districts/NNS for/IN commercial/JJ areas/NNS that/WDT provide/VBP additional/JJ patrols/NNS funded/VBN by/IN local/JJ businesses/NNS ./. 
But/CC this/DT raises/VBZ added/VBN cost/NN barriers/NNS to/TO urban/JJ entrepreneurship/NN ./. 
Another/DT solution/NN cities/NNS might/MD consider/VB is/VBZ giving/VBG special/JJ priority/NN to/TO police/NN patrols/NNS of/IN small-business/NN areas/NNS ./. 
For/IN cities/NNS losing/VBG business/NN to/TO suburban/JJ shopping/NN centers/NNS ,/, it/PP may/MD be/VB a/DT wise/JJ business/NN investment/NN to/TO help/VB keep/VB those/DT jobs/NNS and/CC sales/NNS taxes/NNS within/IN city/NN limits/NNS ./. 
Increased/VBN patrolling/NN of/IN business/NN zones/NNS makes/VBZ sense/NN because/IN urban/JJ crime/NN is/VBZ heavily/RB concentrated/JJ in/IN such/JJ ``/`` hot/JJ spots/NNS ''/'' of/IN pedestrian/NN density/NN ./.

Small-business/NN patrols/NNS would/MD be/VB an/DT especially/RB helpful/JJ gesture/NN whenever/WRB a/DT small-business/NN person/NN is/VBZ scheduled/VBN to/TO testify/VB against/IN a/DT robbery/NN suspect/NN ./.

The/DT picture/NN for/IN China/NP 's/POS exports/NNS is/VBZ just/RB as/RB bleak/JJ ,/, mainly/RB because/IN of/IN the/DT domestic/JJ credit/NN squeeze/NN ./.

The/DT threat/NN to/TO China/NP 's/POS balance/NN of/IN payments/NNS is/VBZ further/RBR aggravated/VBN by/IN the/DT plunge/NN in/IN its/PP$ foreign-exchange/NN reserves/NNS ,/, excluding/VBG gold/NN holdings/NNS ./.

The/DT trend/NN has/VBZ prompted/VBN Beijing/NP to/TO intensify/VB efforts/NNS to/TO curb/VB imports/NNS ./.

For/IN a/DT short/JJ time/NN after/IN June/NP 4/CD ,/, it/PP appeared/VBD that/IN the/DT trade/NN picture/NN would/MD remain/VB fairly/RB bright/JJ ./.

Even/RB the/DT Bank/NP of/IN China/NP ,/, which/WDT normally/RB took/VBD weeks/NNS to/TO process/VB letters/NNS of/IN credit/NN ,/, was/VBD settling/VBG the/DT letters/NNS at/IN record/JJ speed/NN to/TO dispel/VB rumors/NNS about/IN the/DT bank/NN 's/POS financial/JJ health/NN ./.

The/DT suspension/NN of/IN foreign/JJ loans/NNS has/VBZ weakened/VBN the/DT buying/NN power/NN of/IN China/NP 's/POS national/JJ trading/VBG companies/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP among/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS biggest/JJS importers/NNS ./.

Albert/NP Lee/NP ,/, a/DT veteran/NN trader/NN who/WP specializes/VBZ in/IN machinery/NN sales/NNS ,/, estimates/VBZ that/IN as/RB many/JJ as/IN 70/CD %/NN of/IN projects/NNS that/WDT had/VBD obtained/VBN approval/NN to/TO proceed/VB have/VBP been/VBN canceled/VBN in/IN recent/JJ months/NNS ./.

Even/RB when/WRB new/JJ lending/NN resumes/VBZ ,/, foreign/JJ exchange/NN would/MD still/RB be/VB tight/JJ because/IN Beijing/NP will/MD likely/RB try/VB to/TO rein/VB in/RP foreign/JJ borrowing/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ grown/VBN between/IN 30/CD %/NN and/CC 40/CD %/NN in/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./. 
And/CC foreign/JJ creditors/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO be/VB more/RBR cautious/JJ about/IN extending/VBG new/JJ loans/NNS because/IN China/NP is/VBZ nearing/VBG a/DT peak/NN repayment/NN period/NN as/IN many/JJ loans/NNS start/VBP falling/VBG due/JJ in/IN the/DT next/JJ two/CD to/TO five/CD years/NNS ./. 
Another/DT reason/NN for/IN the/DT intensity/NN of/IN the/DT trade/NN problems/NNS is/VBZ that/IN Beijing/NP has/VBZ extended/VBN the/DT current/JJ clampdown/NN on/IN imports/NNS beyond/IN the/DT usual/JJ target/NN of/IN consumer/NN products/NNS to/TO include/VB steel/NN ,/, chemical/NN fertilizers/NNS and/CC plastics/NNS ./. 
These/DT have/VBP been/VBN among/IN the/DT country/NN 's/POS leading/VBG imports/NNS ,/, particularly/RB last/JJ year/NN when/WRB there/EX were/VBD shortages/NNS that/WDT led/VBD many/JJ traders/NNS to/TO buy/VB heavily/RB and/CC pay/VB dearly/RB ./. 
But/CC the/DT shortages/NNS also/RB spawned/VBD rampant/JJ speculation/NN and/CC spiraling/VBG prices/NNS ./. 
To/TO stem/VB speculation/NN ,/, Beijing/NP imposed/VBD ceiling/NN prices/NNS that/WDT went/VBD into/IN effect/NN earlier/RBR this/DT year/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, the/DT question/NN faced/VBN by/IN investors/NNS is/VBZ :/: What/WP is/VBZ UAL/NP stock/NN worth/NN ?/. 
The/DT short/JJ answer/NN ,/, on/IN a/DT fundamental/JJ basis/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN airline/NN analysts/NNS say/VBP the/DT stock/NN is/VBZ worth/JJ somewhere/RB between/IN $/$ 135/CD and/CC $/$ 150/CD a/DT share/NN ./. 
That/DT 's/VBZ based/VBN on/IN a/DT multiple/NN of/IN anywhere/RB between/IN 8.5/CD to/TO 10/CD times/NNS UAL/NP earnings/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP estimated/VBN to/TO come/VB in/IN somewhere/RB around/IN $/$ 16/CD a/DT share/NN this/DT year/NN ./. 
Airline/NN stocks/NNS typically/RB sell/VBP at/IN a/DT discount/NN of/IN about/IN one-third/NN to/TO the/DT stock/NN market/NN 's/POS price-earnings/NNS ratio/NN --/: which/WDT is/VBZ currently/RB about/IN 13/CD times/NNS earnings/NNS ./. 
That/DT 's/VBZ because/IN airline/NN earnings/NNS ,/, like/IN those/DT of/IN auto/NN makers/NNS ,/, have/VBP been/VBN subject/JJ to/TO the/DT cyclical/JJ ups-and-downs/NNS of/IN the/DT economy/NN ./. 
That/DT analysis/NN matches/VBZ up/RB with/IN stock/NN traders/NNS '/POS reports/NNS that/IN ,/, despite/IN the/DT huge/JJ drop/NN in/IN the/DT stock/NN ,/, UAL/NP has/VBZ n't/RB returned/VBN to/TO the/DT level/NN at/IN which/WDT it/PP could/MD attract/VB buying/NN by/IN institutions/NNS solely/RB on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN earnings/NNS ./. 
So/CC anyone/NN buying/VBG the/DT stock/NN now/RB is/VBZ betting/VBG on/IN some/DT special/JJ transaction/NN such/JJ as/IN a/DT recapitalization/NN or/CC takeover/NN ,/, and/CC must/MD do/VB so/RB using/VBG some/DT guesswork/NN about/IN the/DT likelihood/NN of/IN such/JJ an/DT event/NN ./. 
One/CD analyst/NN ,/, who/WP asked/VBD not/RB to/TO be/VB identified/VBN ,/, said/VBD he/PP believes/VBZ that/IN the/DT UAL/NP pilots/NNS and/CC management/NN can/MD put/VB together/RB a/DT bid/NN ``/`` in/IN the/DT $/$ 225/CD area/NN ,/, ''/'' but/CC that/IN it/PP could/MD take/VB three/CD to/TO four/CD months/NNS to/TO close/VB ./. 
At/IN that/DT level/NN ,/, and/CC given/VBN the/DT uncertainty/NN ,/, he/PP believes/VBZ UAL/NP stock/NN should/MD trade/VB closer/RBR to/TO Other/JJ observers/NNS note/VBP that/IN UAL/NP 's/POS board/NN ,/, having/VBG accepted/VBN a/DT bid/NN of/IN $/$ 300/CD a/DT share/NN ,/, might/MD hold/VB out/RB for/IN a/DT new/JJ bid/NN much/RB closer/JJR to/TO the/DT original/NN level/NN --/: even/RB if/IN it/PP means/VBZ that/IN the/DT management/NN goes/VBZ back/RB to/TO running/VBG the/DT company/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN and/CC lets/VBZ things/NNS return/VB to/TO normal/JJ ./. 
By/IN that/DT logic/NN ,/, the/DT closing/NN of/IN a/DT deal/NN could/MD be/VB much/RB further/RB away/RB than/IN three/CD to/TO four/CD months/NNS ,/, even/RB though/IN the/DT eventual/JJ price/NN might/MD be/VB higher/JJR ./. 
Investment/NN bankers/NNS following/VBG UAL/NP agree/VBP that/IN the/DT strongest/JJS impetus/NN for/IN an/DT eventual/JJ deal/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT pilots/NNS have/VBP been/VBN attempting/VBG a/DT buy-out/NN for/IN more/JJR than/IN two/CD years/NNS ,/, and/CC are/VBP n't/RB likely/JJ to/TO stop/VB ,/, having/VBG come/VBN so/RB close/RB to/TO success/NN ./.

Most/JJS of/IN the/DT two/CD dozen/NN scientists/NNS taking/VBG the/DT podium/NN reported/VBD results/NNS with/IN new/JJ ,/, more/RBR sophisticated/JJ variations/NNS of/IN the/DT seemingly/RB simple/JJ electrolysis-of-water/JJ experiments/NNS described/VBN last/JJ March/NP by/IN Messrs./NP Fleischmann/NP and/CC Pons/NP ./. 
The/DT experiments/NNS involve/VBP encircling/VBG a/DT thin/JJ rod/NN of/IN palladium/NN metal/NN with/IN a/DT wire/NN of/IN platinum/NN and/CC plunging/VBG the/DT two/CD electrodes/NNS into/IN ``/`` heavy/JJ ''/'' water/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT hydrogen/NN atoms/NNS are/VBP a/DT doubly/RB heavy/JJ form/NN known/VBN as/IN deuterium/NN ./.

Ordinarily/RB the/DT electrolysis/NN ,/, or/CC breakup/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT water/NN would/MD consume/VB almost/RB all/DT of/IN the/DT electrical/JJ energy/NN ./. 
But/CC Messrs./NNS Fleischmann/NP and/CC Pons/NP said/VBD their/PP$ experiments/NNS also/RB produced/VBD large/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN heat/NN ./. 
The/DT heat/NN energy/NN plus/IN the/DT energy/NN consumed/VBN by/IN the/DT breakup/NN of/IN the/DT water/NN molecules/NNS added/VBD to/TO far/RB more/JJR energy/NN coming/VBG out/IN of/IN the/DT apparatus/NN than/IN electrical/JJ energy/NN going/VBG in/IN ,/, they/PP reported/VBD ./. 
Because/IN they/PP also/RB detected/VBD tritium/NN and/CC indications/NNS of/IN nuclear/JJ radiation/NN ,/, they/PP asserted/VBD that/IN the/DT ``/`` excess/JJ ''/'' heat/NN energy/NN must/MD be/VB coming/VBG from/IN energy/NN released/VBN by/IN the/DT nuclear/JJ fusion/NN of/IN deuterium/NN atoms/NNS inside/IN the/DT palladium/NN rod/NN ./. 
As/IN of/IN last/JJ weekend/NN ,/, a/DT dozen/NN labs/NNS also/RB have/VBP reported/VBN measuring/VBG ``/`` excess/JJ ''/'' heat/NN from/IN similar/JJ electrolytic/JJ experiments/NNS ,/, although/IN amounts/NNS of/IN such/JJ heat/NN vary/VBP widely/RB ./. 
One/CD of/IN the/DT seven/CD reports/NNS presented/VBN here/RB of/IN excess/JJ heat/NN production/NN was/VBD given/VBN by/IN Richard/NP A./NP Oriani/NP ,/, professor/NN of/IN chemical/NN engineering/NN at/IN the/DT University/NP of/IN Minnesota/NP ./. 
Mr./NP Oriani/NP said/VBD his/PP$ skepticism/NN of/IN the/DT Utah/NP claims/NNS was/VBD initially/RB confirmed/VBN when/WRB his/PP$ first/JJ experiments/NNS last/JJ spring/NN failed/VBD to/TO produce/VB results/NNS ./.

``/`` The/DT results/NNS were/VBD fascinating/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PP said/VBD ./. 
On/IN the/DT fourth/JJ ``/`` run/NN ''/'' with/IN the/DT borrowed/VBN rod/NN ,/, the/DT experiment/NN began/VBD producing/VBG excess/JJ heat/NN ./. 
The/DT experiment/NN was/VBD stopped/VBN briefly/NN to/TO change/VB an/DT instrument/NN ./. 
When/WRB it/PP was/VBD restarted/VBN ,/, heat/NN output/NN ``/`` really/RB took/VBD off/RP ''/'' and/CC produced/VBD excess/JJ heat/NN for/IN several/JJ hours/NNS before/IN dying/VBG down/RP ,/, he/PP said/VBD ./. 
Typical/JJ of/IN other/JJ experiments/NNS ,/, Mr./NP Oriani/NP said/VBD his/PP$ experiment/NN was/VBD ``/`` very/RB erratic/JJ ./. 
''/'' It/PP would/MD go/VB along/RP doing/VBG nothing/NN but/CC dissociating/VBG the/DT heavy/NN water/NN and/CC then/RB at/IN totally/RB unpredictable/JJ times/NNS ,/, it/PP would/MD begin/VB producing/VBG excess/JJ heat/NN for/IN as/RB long/JJ as/IN 10/CD or/CC 11/CD hours/NNS before/RB quieting/VBG down/RP ./. 
The/DT excess/JJ heat/NN was/VBD 15/CD %/NN to/TO 20/CD %/NN more/JJR than/IN the/DT energy/NN involved/VBN in/IN the/DT electrolysis/NN of/IN water/NN ./. 
Mr./NP Oriani/NP said/VBD the/DT heat/NN bursts/NNS were/VBD too/RB large/JJ and/CC too/RB long/JJ to/TO be/VB explained/VBN by/IN the/DT sudden/JJ release/NN of/IN energy/NN that/WDT might/MD have/VB slowly/RB accumulated/VBN during/IN the/DT experiments/NNS '/POS quiescent/JJ times/NNS ,/, as/IN some/DT scientists/NNS have/VBP suggested/VBN ./. 
``/`` There/EX is/VBZ a/DT reality/NN to/TO the/DT excess/JJ energy/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PP said/VBD ./. 
Other/JJ scientists/NNS said/VBD they/PP also/RB were/VBD getting/VBG sporadic/JJ bursts/NNS of/IN excess/JJ heat/NN lasting/VBG several/JJ hours/NNS at/IN a/DT time/NN ./. 
The/DT bursts/NNS often/RB occur/VBP ,/, they/PP said/VBD ,/, after/RB they/PP ``/`` perturbed/VBD ''/'' the/DT experiments/NNS by/IN raising/VBG or/CC lowering/VBG the/DT amount/NN of/IN electric/JJ current/JJ being/VBG applied/VBN ,/, or/CC switching/VBG the/DT current/NN off/RP and/CC on/RP ./. 
One/CD chemist/NN privately/RB suggested/VBD this/DT hinted/VBD that/IN some/DT ``/`` anomalous/JJ ''/'' chemical/JJ reactions/NNS might/MD be/VB producing/VBG the/DT heat/NN ./. 
One/CD reason/NN questions/NNS surround/VBP the/DT heat/NN experiments/NNS is/VBZ that/IN they/PP involve/VBP unusually/RB meticulous/JJ measurements/NNS ./. 
Typically/RB ,/, the/DT input/NN energy/NN ranges/VBZ from/IN a/DT third/JJ of/IN a/DT watt/NN to/TO one/CD watt/NN and/CC the/DT excess/JJ energy/NN is/VBZ measured/VBN in/IN tenths/NNS of/IN a/DT watt/NN ./. 
One/CD exception/NN is/VBZ a/DT continuing/VBG experiment/NN at/IN Stanford/NP University/NP where/WRB as/RB much/JJ as/IN 10/CD watts/NNS of/IN energy/NN are/VBP being/VBG put/VBD into/IN the/DT electrolytic/JJ cells/NNS ./. 
A/DT cell/NN filled/VBN with/IN heavy/JJ water/NN is/VBZ producing/VBG 1.0/CD to/TO 1.5/CD watts/NNS more/JJR heat/NN than/IN an/DT identical/JJ electrolytic/JJ cell/NN filled/VBN with/IN ordinary/JJ water/NN next/JJ to/TO it/PP ,/, reported/VBD Turgut/NP M./NP Gur/NP ,/, an/DT associate/NN of/IN materials/NNS scientist/NN Robert/NP A./NP Huggins/NP ,/, head/NN of/IN the/DT Stanford/NP experimental/JJ team/NN ./. 
One/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ hints/NNS the/DT excess/JJ heat/NN might/MD be/VB produced/VBN by/IN fusion/NN came/VBD from/IN brief/JJ remarks/NNS by/IN chemist/NN John/NP Bockris/NP of/IN Texas/NP A&M/NP University/NP ./. 
Mr./NP Bockris/NP previously/RB reported/VBD getting/VBG bursts/NNS of/IN excess/JJ heat/NN and/CC of/IN detecting/VBG increasing/VBG amounts/NNS of/IN tritium/NN forming/VBG in/IN the/DT heavy/JJ water/NN ./. 
He/PP said/VBD that/IN within/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ days/NNS ,/, he/PP 's/VBZ gotten/VBN evidence/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT ``/`` weak/JJ correlation/NN ''/'' between/IN the/DT time/NN the/DT heat/NN bursts/NNS occur/VBP and/CC the/DT production/NN of/IN tritium/NN ./. 
There/EX is/VBZ n't/RB any/DT way/NN to/TO continuously/RB measure/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN tritium/NN in/IN the/DT heavy/JJ water/NN ,/, so/IN it/PP 's/VBZ been/VBN difficult/JJ to/TO tell/VB whether/CC the/DT tritium/NN formation/NN is/VBZ related/VBN to/TO the/DT heat/NN bursts/NNS or/CC some/DT other/JJ phenomenon/NN ./. 
Increasingly/RB careful/JJ attempts/NNS to/TO measure/VB neutrons/NNS ,/, which/WDT would/MD be/VB strong/JJ evidence/NN of/IN fusion/NN reactions/NNS ,/, continue/VBP to/TO be/VB negative/JJ ./. 
Messrs./NNS Fleischmann/NP and/CC Pons/NP initially/RB reported/VBD indirect/JJ evidence/NN of/IN neutrons/NNS being/VBG produced/VBN in/IN their/PP$ experiment/NN but/CC later/RB conceded/VBD the/DT measurements/NNS were/VBD questionable/JJ ./. 
Researchers/NNS at/IN Sandia/NP National/NP Laboratories/NP in/IN Albuquerque/NP ,/, N.M./NP ,/, reported/VBD they/PP went/VBD so/RB far/RB as/IN to/TO take/VB a/DT ``/`` cold/JJ fusion/NN ''/'' experiment/NN and/CC three/CD neutron/NN detectors/NNS into/IN a/DT tunnel/NN under/IN 300/CD feet/NNS of/IN granite/NN to/TO shield/VB the/DT detectors/NNS from/IN cosmic/JJ rays/NNS ./. 
A/DT number/NN of/IN times/NNS they/PP detected/VBD neutrons/NNS in/IN one/CD ,/, sometimes/RB two/CD ,/, of/IN the/DT three/CD detectors/NNS ,/, but/CC only/RB once/RB during/IN 411/CD hours/NNS of/IN the/DT experiment/NN did/VBD they/PP detect/VB a/DT neutron/NN burst/NN in/IN all/DT three/CD detectors/NNS --/: and/CC they/PP think/VBP that/DT was/VBD a/DT spurious/JJ event/NN ./. 
Shimson/NP Gottesfeld/NP of/IN Los/NP Alamos/NP National/NP Laboratory/NP said/VBD researchers/NNS there/RB detected/VBD a/DT burst/NN of/IN neutrons/NNS from/IN an/DT early/JJ cold/JJ fusion/NN experiment/NN last/JJ April/NP but/CC decided/VBD not/RB to/TO announce/VB it/PP until/IN they/PP could/MD confirm/VB it/PP ./. 
In/IN subsequent/JJ experiments/NNS ,/, one/CD of/IN two/CD neutron/NN detectors/NNS occasionally/RB indicated/VBD a/DT burst/NN of/IN neutrons/NNS but/CC neutron/NN bursts/NNS were/VBD never/RB recorded/VBN in/IN both/DT detectors/NNS at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./. 
They/PP concluded/VBD the/DT indications/NNS of/IN neutrons/NNS stemmed/VBD from/IN faults/NNS in/IN the/DT detectors/NNS rather/RB than/IN from/IN the/DT cold/JJ fusion/NN experiment/NN ./.

That/DT trend/NN could/MD increase/VB demand/VB for/IN hot-dipped/JJ galvanized/JJ sheet/NN ./. 
The/DT hot-dipped/JJ galvanized/JJ segment/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT fastest-growing/JJ and/CC most/RBS profitable/JJ segments/NNS of/IN the/DT steel/NN market/NN ,/, coveted/VBN by/IN all/DT major/JJ integrated/VBN steelmakers/NNS wanting/VBG to/TO maintain/VB an/DT edge/NN over/IN smaller/JJR minimills/NNS and/CC reconstructed/JJ mills/NNS --/: those/DT spun/VBD off/IN to/TO employees/NNS ./.

ONCE/RB YOU/PP MAKE/VB UP/IN your/PP$ mind/NN about/IN an/DT investment/NN ,/, the/DT rest/NN is/VBZ easy/JJ ,/, right/JJ ?/. 
You/PP just/RB call/VB your/PP$ broker/NN and/CC say/VB ``/`` buy/VB ''/'' or/CC ``/`` sell/VB ./.

Market/NP Order/NP :/: This/DT is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT most/RBS widely/RB used/VBN order/NN --/: and/CC the/DT one/CD most/RBS open/JJ to/TO abuse/VB by/IN unscrupulous/JJ floor/NN brokers/NNS ,/, since/IN it/PP imposes/VBZ no/DT price/NN restrictions/NNS ./. 
With/IN a/DT market/NN order/NN ,/, an/DT investor/NN tells/VBZ a/DT broker/NN to/TO buy/VB or/CC sell/VB ``/`` at/IN the/DT market/NN ./. 
''/'' It/PP 's/POS like/IN saying/VBG ,/, ``/`` get/VB me/PP in/IN now/RB ''/'' or/CC ``/`` get/VB me/PP out/IN now/RB ./. 
''/'' For/IN example/NN ,/, if/IN wheat/NN is/VBZ being/VBG offered/VBN at/IN $/$ 4.065/CD and/CC bid/VBD at/IN $/$ 4.060/CD ,/, a/DT market/NN order/NN to/TO buy/VB would/MD be/VB filled/VBN at/IN the/DT higher/JJR price/NN and/CC a/DT market/NN order/NN to/TO sell/VB at/IN the/DT lower/JJR price/NN ./. 
A/DT recent/JJ indictment/NN alleges/VBZ that/IN some/DT floor/NN brokers/NNS at/IN the/DT two/CD largest/JJS Chicago/NP commodity/NN exchanges/NNS used/VBD market/NN orders/NNS to/TO fill/VB customers/NNS '/POS orders/NNS at/IN unfavorable/JJ prices/NNS by/IN arranging/VBG trades/NNS with/IN fellow/NN brokers/NNS ./. 
Profits/NNS realized/VBD from/IN these/DT trades/NNS would/MD then/RB be/VB shared/VBN by/IN the/DT conspiring/VBG brokers/NNS ./. 
Limit/NP Order/NP :/: Limit/NN orders/NNS are/VBP used/VBN when/WRB investors/NNS want/VB to/TO restrict/VB the/DT amount/NN they/PP will/MD receive/VB or/CC pay/VB for/IN an/DT investment/NN ./.

A/DT limit/NN order/NN to/TO sell/VB could/MD be/VB entered/VBN at/IN that/DT price/NN ./. 
One/CD risk/NN :/: Investors/NNS may/MD regret/VB the/DT restriction/NN if/IN the/DT stock/NN reaches/VBZ 54/CD and/CC then/RB falls/VBZ ./. 
Unless/IN the/DT market/NN goes/VBZ at/IN least/JJS one/CD tick/NN (/( the/DT smallest/JJS price/NN increment/NN permitted/VBN )/) beyond/IN the/DT limit/NN price/NN ,/, investors/NNS are/VBP n't/RB assured/VBN of/IN having/VBG their/PP$ orders/NNS filled/VBD because/IN there/EX may/MD not/RB be/VB sufficient/JJ trading/VBG volume/NN to/TO permit/VB filling/VBG it/PP at/IN the/DT specified/VBN price/NN ./. 
Stop/NP Order/NP :/: Stop/VB orders/NNS tell/VB a/DT floor/NN broker/NN to/TO buy/VB or/CC sell/VB an/DT investment/NN once/IN the/DT price/NN reaches/VBZ a/DT certain/JJ level/NN ./. 
Once/RB the/DT price/NN reaches/VBZ that/DT level/NN ,/, a/DT stop/NN order/NN turns/VBZ into/IN a/DT market/NN order/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT order/NN is/VBZ filled/VBN at/IN whatever/WDT price/NN the/DT broker/NN can/MD get/VB ./. 
Stop/NN orders/NNS are/VBP sometimes/RB called/VBN ``/`` stop-loss/NN ''/'' orders/NNS because/IN they/PP are/VBP frequently/RB used/VBN to/TO protect/VB profits/NNS or/CC limit/NN losses/NNS ./. 
While/IN stop/NN orders/NNS sound/VB similar/JJ to/TO limit/NN orders/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT difference/NN :/: Sell/VB stops/NNS must/MD be/VB entered/VBN at/IN a/DT price/NN below/IN the/DT current/JJ market/NN price/NN and/CC buy/VB stops/NNS above/IN ./. 
In/IN contrast/NN ,/, sell/VB limit/NN orders/NNS must/MD be/VB placed/VBN above/IN the/DT market/NN price/NN and/CC buy/VB limit/NN orders/NNS are/VBP placed/VBN below/IN ./. 
The/DT crash/NN in/IN October/NP 1987/CD and/CC last/JJ Friday/NP 's/POS sell-off/NN painfully/RB taught/VBD some/DT investors/NNS exactly/RB what/WP stop/VB orders/NNS will/MD and/CC wo/MD n't/RB do/VB ./. 
An/DT investor/NN who/WP may/MD have/VB placed/VBN a/DT stop-loss/NN order/NN at/IN $/$ 90/CD under/IN a/DT stock/NN that/WDT was/VBD trading/VBG at/IN $/$ 100/CD a/DT share/NN on/IN the/DT Friday/NP before/IN the/DT crash/NN was/VBD stunned/VBN to/TO discover/VB that/IN the/DT order/NN was/VBD filled/VBN at/IN $/$ 75/CD when/WRB the/DT stock/NN opened/VBD at/IN that/DT price/NN on/IN Monday/NP ./. 
Stop-Limit/NP Order/NP :/: Stop-limit/JJ orders/NNS turn/VB into/IN limit/NN orders/NNS when/WRB an/DT investment/NN trades/VBZ at/IN the/DT price/NN specified/VBN in/IN the/DT order/NN ./. 
Unlike/IN stop/NN orders/NNS --/: which/WDT are/VBP filled/VBN at/IN the/DT market/NN price/NN when/WRB the/DT stop/NN price/NN is/VBZ hit/VBN --/: stop-limit/JJ orders/NNS demand/VB that/IN the/DT trades/NNS be/VB made/VBN only/RB at/IN the/DT specified/VBN price/NN ./.

It/PP is/VBZ always/RB the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN investors/NNS to/TO keep/VB track/NN of/IN the/DT orders/NNS they/PP have/VB placed/VBN ./. 
Investors/NNS who/WP change/VB their/PP$ mind/NN about/IN buying/VBG or/CC selling/VBG after/IN an/DT order/NN has/VBZ been/VBN filled/VBN are/VBP ,/, usually/RB ,/, stuck/VBD with/IN the/DT consequences/NNS ./. 
Mr./NP Angrist/NP writes/VBZ on/IN the/DT options/NNS and/CC commodities/NNS markets/NNS for/IN The/DT Wall/NP Street/NP Journal/NP ./.

Beta/NN is/VBZ a/DT handy/JJ gauge/NN that/WDT measures/VBZ the/DT volatility/NN of/IN a/DT stock/NN or/CC stock/NN mutual/JJ fund/NN ./. 
For/IN any/DT given/VBN move/NN in/IN the/DT overall/JJ market/NN ,/, it/PP suggests/VBZ how/WRB steeply/RB that/IN particular/JJ issue/NN might/MD rise/VB or/CC fall/VB ./.

Remember/VB ,/, though/RB ,/, that/DT beta/NN also/RB has/VBZ important/JJ limitations/NNS ./. 
``/`` Beta/NN is/VBZ only/RB part/NN of/IN the/DT risk/NN in/IN a/DT stock/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ William/NP F./NP Sharpe/NP ,/, the/DT Stanford/NP University/NP emeritus/JJ professor/NN who/WP developed/VBD the/DT measure/NN ./.

''/'' In/IN particular/JJ ,/, beta/JJ does/VBZ n't/RB measure/VB the/DT company/NN -/: and/CC industry-specific/JJ risk/NN associated/VBN with/IN an/DT individual/JJ stock/NN ./. 
That/IN ``/`` business/NN ''/'' risk/NN is/VBZ very/RB significant/JJ for/IN an/DT investor/NN with/IN only/RB a/DT few/JJ stocks/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PP virtually/RB disappears/VBZ in/IN a/DT large/JJ and/CC well-diversified/JJ portfolio/NN ./. 
Beta/NN is/VBZ also/RB a/DT poor/JJ indicator/NN of/IN the/DT risk/NN in/IN stock/NN groups/NNS that/WDT march/VB to/TO their/PP$ own/JJ drummer/NN ./. 
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, the/DT prices/NNS of/IN gold/NN and/CC other/JJ precious-metals/JJ stocks/NNS shoot/VB up/IN and/CC down/IN ,/, but/CC the/DT stocks/NNS tend/VB to/TO have/VB low/JJ betas/NNS because/IN their/PP$ moves/NNS are/VBP not/RB market-inspired/JJ ./. 
Concern/NN that/IN investors/NNS could/MD misinterpret/VB such/JJ readings/NNS led/VBD the/DT American/NP Association/NP of/IN Individual/NP Investors/NP to/TO eliminate/VB beta/JJ figures/NNS for/IN precious-metals/JJ funds/NNS in/IN the/DT 1989/CD edition/NN of/IN its/PP$ mutual-fund/JJ guide/NN ./. 
``/`` Our/PP$ fear/NN was/VBD people/NNS would/MD look/VB just/RB at/IN the/DT beta/NN {/( of/IN a/DT gold/JJ fund/NN }/) and/CC say/VB here/RB is/VBZ an/DT investment/NN with/IN very/RB low/JJ risk/VB ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ John/NP Markese/NP ,/, director/NN of/IN research/NN for/IN the/DT Chicago-based/JJ group/NN ./.

If/IN you/PP 're/VBP like/IN most/JJS people/NNS ,/, you/PP said/VBD it/PP 's/VBZ a/DT holding/NN that/WDT goes/VBZ completely/RB sour/JJ --/: maybe/RB a/DT bond/NN that/IN defaults/NNS or/CC a/DT stock/NN whose/WP$ value/NN disappears/VBZ in/IN a/DT bankruptcy/NN proceeding/NN ./. 
``/`` People/NNS tend/VB to/TO see/VB risk/NN primarily/RB on/IN that/DT one/CD dimension/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Timothy/NP Kochis/NP ,/, national/JJ director/NN of/IN personal/NN financial/JJ planning/NN for/IN accountants/NNS Deloitte/NP ,/, Haskins/NP &/CC Sells/NP ./. 
But/CC therein/RB lies/VBZ another/DT aspect/NN of/IN investment/NN risk/NN :/: the/DT hazard/NN of/IN shaping/VBG your/PP$ portfolio/NN to/TO avoid/VB one/CD or/CC more/JJR types/NNS of/IN risk/NN and/CC being/VBG blind-sided/JJ by/IN others/NNS ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ clearly/RB not/RB good/JJ news/NN to/TO all/DT you/PP people/NNS who/WP sleep/VB like/IN babies/NNS every/DT night/NN ,/, lulled/VBN by/IN visions/NNS of/IN your/PP$ money/NN sitting/VBG risk-free/JJ in/IN six-month/JJ CDs/NNS ./. 
Risk/NN wears/VBZ many/JJ disguises/NNS ,/, and/CC investments/NNS that/WDT are/VBP low/JJ in/IN one/CD type/NN of/IN obvious/JJ risk/NN can/MD be/VB distressingly/RB high/JJ in/IN other/JJ ,/, less/RBR obvious/JJ kinds/NNS ./. 
U.S./NP Treasury/NP bonds/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, are/VBP supersafe/NN when/WRB it/PP comes/VBZ to/TO returning/VBG money/NN at/IN maturity/NN ./. 
But/CC their/PP$ value/NN as/IN investments/NNS can/MD be/VB decimated/VBN by/IN inflation/NN ,/, which/WDT erodes/VBZ the/DT purchasing/VBG power/NN of/IN bonds/NNS '/POS fixed-dollar/JJ interest/NN payments/NNS ./. 
Risk/NN is/VBZ also/RB a/DT function/NN of/IN time/NN ./. 
When/WRB financial/JJ professionals/NNS measure/VB risk/NN mathematically/RB ,/, they/PP usually/RB focus/VB on/IN the/DT volatility/NN of/IN short-term/JJ returns/NNS ./. 
Stocks/NNS are/VBP much/RB riskier/JJR than/IN Treasury/NP bills/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT range/NN in/IN performance/NN from/IN the/DT best/JJS years/NNS to/TO the/DT worst/JJS is/VBZ much/RB wider/JJR ./. 
That/DT is/VBZ usually/RB measured/VBN by/IN the/DT standard/JJ deviation/NN ,/, or/CC divergence/NN ,/, of/IN annual/JJ results/NNS from/IN the/DT average/JJ return/NN over/IN time/NN ./. 
But/CC investors/NNS who/WP are/VBP preoccupied/VBN with/IN short-term/JJ fluctuations/NNS may/MD be/VB paying/VBG too/RB little/JJ attention/NN to/TO another/DT big/JJ risk/NN --/: not/RB generating/VBG enough/JJ money/NN to/TO meet/VB long-term/JJ financial/JJ and/CC life-style/JJ goals/NNS ./. 
For/IN instance/NN ,/, some/DT investors/NNS have/VB sworn/VBN off/IN stocks/NNS since/IN the/DT 1987/CD market/NN crash/NN ;/: last/JJ Friday/NP 's/POS debacle/NN only/RB reinforced/VBD those/DT feelings/NNS ./. 
But/CC the/DT stock/NN market/NN ,/, despite/IN some/DT stomach-churning/JJ declines/NNS ,/, has/VBZ far/RB outperformed/VBN other/JJ securities/NNS over/IN extended/VBN periods/NNS ./. 
By/IN retreating/VBG to/TO the/DT apparent/JJ security/NN of/IN ,/, say/VB ,/, money-market/JJ funds/NNS ,/, investors/NNS may/MD not/RB be/VB earning/VBG enough/JJ investment/NN return/VB to/TO pay/VB for/IN a/DT comfortable/JJ retirement/NN ./. 
``/`` That/DT 's/VBZ the/DT biggest/JJS risk/NN of/IN all/DT --/: the/DT risk/NN of/IN not/RB meeting/VBG your/PP$ objectives/NNS ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Steven/NP B./NP Enright/NP ,/, a/DT New/NP York/NP financial/JJ planner/NN with/IN Seidman/NP Financial/NP Services/NP ./. 
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, financial/JJ advisers/NNS say/VB they/PP take/VB several/JJ steps/NNS when/WRB evaluating/VBG the/DT riskiness/NN of/IN clients/NNS '/POS portfolios/NNS ./. 
They/PP estimate/VB the/DT return/NN a/DT person/NN 's/POS current/JJ portfolio/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO generate/VB over/IN time/NN ,/, along/IN with/IN a/DT standard/JJ deviation/NN that/WDT suggests/VBZ how/WRB much/RB the/DT return/NN will/MD vary/VB year/NN by/IN year/NN ./. 
They/PP try/VB to/TO figure/VB out/IN the/DT long-term/NN results/VBZ the/DT person/NN needs/VBZ to/TO meet/VB major/JJ goals/NNS ./. 
And/CC they/PP eyeball/NN types/NNS of/IN risk/NN that/WDT are/VBP not/RB easily/RB quantified/VBN ./. 
The/DT portfolios/NNS of/IN two/CD hypothetical/JJ families/NNS ,/, one/CD a/DT couple/NN at/IN retirement/NN age/NN and/CC another/DT a/DT two-income/NN couple/NN at/IN age/NN 45/CD ,/, illustrate/VB several/JJ types/NNS of/IN risk/NN that/IN investors/NNS need/VB to/TO consider/VB ./.

The/DT younger/JJR couple/NN 's/POS stockholdings/NNS involve/VB more/JJR risk/NN than/IN a/DT diversified/VBN stock/NN portfolio/NN because/IN the/DT bulk/NN of/IN the/DT money/NN is/VBZ in/IN a/DT single/JJ issue/NN ./.

Mr./NP Hauptman/NP reckons/VBZ that/IN the/DT best/JJS investment/NN choice/NN is/VBZ mutual/JJ funds/NNS because/IN they/PP are/VBP managed/VBN and/CC over/IN time/NN have/VBP nearly/RB kept/VBN up/RP with/IN the/DT broad/JJ stock/NN averages/NNS ./. 
He/PP favors/VBZ either/RB an/DT all-stock/JJ fund/NN or/CC a/DT balanced/VBN fund/NN that/IN mixes/VBZ both/DT stocks/NNS and/CC bonds/NNS ./. 
In/IN their/PP$ anxiety/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, parents/NNS and/CC other/JJ student/NN benefactors/NNS are/VBP flocking/VBG to/TO new/JJ schemes/NNS ./.

The/DT prepaid/JJ plans/NNS take/VBP payment/NN today/NN --/: usually/RB at/IN current/JJ tuitions/NNS or/CC at/IN a/DT slight/JJ discount/NN --/: for/IN a/DT promise/NN that/DT tuition/NN will/MD be/VB covered/VBN tomorrow/NN ./.

Shorn/VBN of/IN all/DT their/PP$ riders/NNS ,/, special/JJ provisions/NNS ,/, and/CC other/JJ bells/NNS and/CC whistles/NNS ,/, insurance/NN policies/NNS can/MD still/RB be/VB grouped/VBN under/IN two/CD broad/JJ categories/NNS :/: so-called/JJ pure/JJ insurance/NN ,/, which/WDT amasses/VBZ no/DT cash/NN value/NN in/IN the/DT policy/NN and/CC pays/VBZ off/RP only/RB upon/IN death/NN ,/, and/CC permanent/JJ insurance/NN ,/, which/WDT provides/VBZ not/RB only/RB a/DT death/NN benefit/NN but/CC also/RB a/DT cash/NN value/NN in/IN the/DT policy/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB used/VBN in/IN various/JJ ways/NNS while/IN the/DT insured/VBN is/VBZ still/RB alive/JJ ./. 
If/IN all/DT you/PP want/VBP is/VBZ death-benefit/JJ coverage/NN ,/, pure/JJ insurance/NN --/: a/DT term/NN policy/NN --/: gives/VBZ you/PP maximum/NN bang/NN for/IN your/PP$ buck/NN ,/, within/IN limits/NNS ./. 
It/PP 's/VBZ much/RB cheaper/JJR than/IN permanent/JJ insurance/NN bought/VBN at/IN the/DT same/JJ age/NN ./. 
But/CC ``/`` term/NN ''/'' means/VBZ just/RB that/DT ;/: the/DT policy/NN is/VBZ written/VBN for/IN a/DT specific/JJ time/NN period/NN only/RB and/CC must/MD be/VB renewed/VBN when/WRB it/PP expires/VBZ ./. 
It/PP may/MD also/RB stipulate/VB that/IN the/DT insured/NN must/MD pass/VB another/DT medical/JJ exam/NN before/IN renewal/NN ;/: if/IN you/PP flunk/VBP --/: which/WDT means/VBZ you/PP need/VBP insurance/NN more/RBR than/IN ever/RB --/: you/PP may/MD not/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO buy/VB it/PP ./. 
Even/RB if/IN you/PP 're/VBP healthy/JJ and/CC can/MD renew/VB ,/, your/PP$ premium/NN will/MD go/VB up/RB sharply/RB because/IN you/PP 're/VBP that/DT much/RB older/JJR ./. 
So/IN term/NN insurance/NN may/MD not/RB be/VB as/RB cheap/JJ as/IN it/PP looks/VBZ ./.

One/CD variation/NN that/WDT appealed/VBD to/TO me/PP at/IN first/JJ was/VBD the/DT ``/`` Money/NP Smart/NP Term/NP Life/NP ''/'' policy/NN offered/VBN by/IN Amex/NP Life/NP Insurance/NP Co./NP ,/, the/DT American/NP Express/NP unit/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT parent/NN company/NN 's/POS credit-card/NN holders/NNS ./. 
Upon/IN examination/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, I/PP wondered/VBD whether/IN the/DT plan/NN made/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN sense/NN ./. 
Amex/NP said/VBD it/PP would/MD charge/VB me/PP $/$ 576/CD a/DT year/NN for/IN $/$ 100,000/CD of/IN coverage/NN --/: and/CC would/MD pay/VB me/PP back/RB all/DT the/DT premiums/NNS I/PP put/VBD in/RP if/IN I/PP canceled/VBD the/DT policy/NN after/IN 10/CD years/NNS ./.

First/RB ,/, if/IN I/PP canceled/VBD ,/, I/PP 'd/MD have/VB no/DT more/JJR insurance/NN ,/, a/DT not/RB insignificant/JJ consideration/NN ./.

Third/JJ and/CC most/RBS important/JJ ,/, Amex/NP would/MD charge/VB me/PP a/DT far/RB higher/JJR premium/NN than/IN other/JJ reputable/JJ companies/NNS would/MD on/IN a/DT straight/JJ term/NN policy/NN for/IN the/DT same/JJ amount/NN ;/: I/PP 'd/MD be/VB paying/VBG so/RB heavily/RB just/RB to/TO have/VB the/DT option/NN of/IN getting/VBG my/PP$ premiums/NNS back/RB that/IN I/PP 'd/MD almost/RB have/VB to/TO cancel/VB to/TO make/VB the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN worthwhile/JJ ./. 
That/DT would/MD be/VB all/RB right/JJ with/IN Amex/NP ,/, which/WDT could/MD then/RB lock/VB in/IN its/PP$ investment/NN profit/NN ,/, but/CC it/PP does/VBZ n't/RB add/VB up/RP to/TO a/DT ``/`` smart/JJ money/NN ''/'' move/NN for/IN me/PP ./. 
Which/WDT goes/VBZ to/TO show/VB that/IN the/DT First/NP Law/NP applies/VBZ in/IN insurance/NN as/IN in/IN anything/NN else/RB :/: There/EX is/VBZ no/DT free/JJ lunch/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ only/RB marketing/NN ./. 
And/CC the/DT Second/NP Law/NP ,/, unique/JJ to/TO insurance/NN ?/. 
If/IN I/PP die/VBP early/RB ,/, I/PP win/VBP --/: a/DT hollow/JJ victory/NN ,/, since/IN I/PP ca/MD n't/RB enjoy/VB it/PP --/: and/CC if/IN I/PP live/VBP long/RB ,/, the/DT insurer/NN wins/VBZ ./. 
Always/RB ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ worth/JJ remembering/VBG when/WRB insurers/NNS and/CC their/PP$ salesmen/NNS try/VBP to/TO sell/VB you/PP permanent/JJ insurance/NN ,/, the/DT kind/NN that/WDT amasses/VBZ cash/NN value/NN ./. 
The/DT word/NN ``/`` death/NN ''/'' can/MD not/RB be/VB escaped/VBN entirely/RB by/IN the/DT industry/NN ,/, but/CC salesmen/NNS dodge/VBP it/PP wherever/WRB possible/JJ or/CC cloak/VBP it/PP in/IN euphemisms/NNS ,/, preferring/VBG to/TO talk/VB about/IN ``/`` savings/NNS ''/'' and/CC ``/`` investment/NN ''/'' instead/RB ./. 
The/DT implication/NN is/VBZ that/DT your/PP$ permanent-insurance/JJ policy/NN is/VBZ really/RB some/DT kind/NN of/IN CD/NP or/CC mutual-fund/JJ account/NN with/IN an/DT added/VBN feature/NN ./. 
That/DT is/VBZ gilding/NN the/DT lily/NN ./. 
The/DT fact/NN is/VBZ that/IN as/IN a/DT savings/NNS or/CC investment/NN vehicle/NN ,/, insurance/NN generally/RB runs/VBZ a/DT poor/JJ second/NN to/TO any/DT direct/JJ investment/NN you/PP might/MD make/VB in/IN the/DT same/JJ things/NNS the/DT insurance/NN company/NN is/VBZ putting/VBG your/PP$ money/NN into/IN ./. 
That/DT 's/VBZ because/IN you/PP have/VBP to/TO pay/VB for/IN the/DT insurance/NN portion/NN of/IN the/DT policy/NN and/CC the/DT effort/NN required/VBN to/TO sell/VB and/CC service/VB the/DT whole/JJ package/NN ./. 
Again/RB ,/, no/DT free/JJ lunch/NN ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ reflected/VBN in/IN a/DT built-in/JJ mortality/NN cost/NN --/: in/IN effect/NN ,/, your/PP$ share/NN of/IN the/DT company/NN 's/POS estimated/VBN liability/NN in/IN paying/VBG off/RP beneficiaries/NNS of/IN people/NNS who/WP had/VBD the/DT effrontery/NN to/TO die/VB while/IN under/IN its/PP$ protection/NN ./. 
And/CC in/IN most/JJS cases/NNS ,/, a/DT huge/JJ hunk/NN of/IN your/PP$ premium/NN in/IN the/DT initial/JJ year/NN or/CC two/CD of/IN the/DT the/DT policy/NN is/VBZ ,/, in/IN effect/NN ,/, paying/VBG the/DT salesman/NN 's/POS commission/NN as/RB well/RB ;/: investment/NN returns/NNS on/IN most/JJS policies/NNS are/VBP actually/RB negative/JJ for/IN several/JJ years/NNS ,/, largely/RB because/IN of/IN this/DT ./. 
So/RB view/VB permanent/JJ insurance/NN for/IN what/WP it/PP is/VBZ --/: a/DT compromise/NN between/IN pure/JJ insurance/NN and/CC direct/JJ investment/NN ./. 
The/DT simplest/JJS ,/, most/RBS traditional/JJ form/NN of/IN permanent/JJ insurance/NN is/VBZ the/DT straight/JJ whole/JJ life/NN policy/NN ./. 
You/PP pay/VBP a/DT set/VBN premium/NN for/IN a/DT set/VBN amount/NN of/IN coverage/NN ,/, the/DT company/NN invests/VBZ that/DT premium/NN in/IN a/DT portfolio/NN of/IN its/PP$ choosing/NN ,/, and/CC your/PP$ cash/NN value/NN and/CC dividends/NNS grow/VBP over/IN the/DT years/NNS ./. 
One/CD newer/JJR wrinkle/NN ,/, so/RB called/VBN single-premium/JJ life/NN (/( you/PP pay/VBP for/IN the/DT whole/JJ policy/NN at/IN once/RB )/) ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN immensely/RB popular/JJ in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS for/IN tax/NN reasons/NNS ;/: the/DT insured/VBN could/MD extract/VB cash/NN value/NN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN policy/NN ``/`` loans/NNS ,/, ''/'' and/CC none/NN of/IN the/DT proceeds/NNS were/VBD taxable/JJ even/RB though/IN they/PP included/VBD gains/NNS on/IN investment/NN ./. 
Congress/NP closed/VBD this/DT loophole/NN last/JJ year/NN ,/, or/CC thought/VBD it/PP did/VBD ./. 
However/RB ,/, Monarch/NP Capital/NP Corp./NP of/IN Springfield/NP ,/, Mass./NP ,/, has/VBZ developed/VBN a/DT ``/`` combination/NN plan/NN ''/'' of/IN annuity/NN and/CC insurance/NN coverage/NN that/IN it/PP says/VBZ does/VBZ not/RB violate/VB the/DT new/JJ regulations/NNS and/CC that/DT allows/VBZ policy/NN loans/NNS without/IN tax/NN consequences/NNS ./. 
But/CC the/DT percentage/NN of/IN your/PP$ cash/NN reserve/NN that/IN you/PP can/MD borrow/VB tax-free/JJ is/VBZ very/RB small/JJ ./. 
I/PP 'm/VBP not/RB prepared/VBN in/IN any/DT case/NN to/TO put/VB that/DT much/JJ money/NN into/IN a/DT policy/NN immediately/RB ,/, so/IN I/PP look/VBP into/IN the/DT broad/JJ category/NN called/VBD universal/JJ life/NN ./.

I/PP can/MD adjust/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN insurance/NN I/PP want/VBP against/IN the/DT amount/NN going/VBG into/IN investment/NN ;/: I/PP can/MD pay/VB more/JJR or/CC less/JJR than/IN the/DT so-called/JJ target/NN premium/NN in/IN a/DT given/VBN year/NN ;/: and/CC I/PP can/MD even/RB skip/VB payments/NNS if/IN my/PP$ cash/NN reserves/NNS are/VBP enough/JJ to/TO cover/VB the/DT insurance/NN portion/NN of/IN the/DT policy/NN ./. 
In/IN looking/VBG at/IN these/DT and/CC other/JJ policies/NNS ,/, I/PP learn/VBP to/TO ask/VB pointed/JJ questions/NNS about/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT assumptions/NNS built/VBN into/IN ``/`` policy/NN illustrations/NNS ''/'' --/: the/DT rows/NNS of/IN numbers/NNS that/WDT show/VBP me/PP the/DT buildup/NN of/IN my/PP$ cash/NN values/NNS over/IN the/DT years/NNS ./. 
They/PP commonly/RB give/VB two/CD scenarios/NNS :/: One/CD is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN interest/NN rates/NNS that/IN the/DT company/NN guarantees/VBZ (/( usually/RB 4/CD %/NN to/TO 4.5/CD %/NN )/) and/CC the/DT other/JJ on/IN the/DT rate/NN it/PP is/VBZ currently/RB getting/VBG on/IN investment/NN ,/, often/RB 8.5/CD %/NN or/CC more/JJR ./. 
Projecting/VBG the/DT latter/JJ over/IN several/JJ decades/NNS ,/, I/PP find/VBP my/PP$ cash/NN buildup/NN is/VBZ impressive/JJ --/: but/CC can/MD any/DT high/JJ interest/NN rate/NN prevail/VB for/IN that/DT long/RB ?/. 
Not/RB likely/RB ,/, I/PP think/VBP ./. 
Also/RB ,/, some/DT policy/NN illustrations/NNS assume/VBP that/IN mortality/NN costs/NNS will/MD decline/VB or/CC that/IN I/PP will/MD get/VB some/DT sort/NN of/IN dividend/NN bonus/NN after/IN the/DT 10th/JJ year/NN ./.

Another/DT factor/NN to/TO consider/VB :/: Some/DT of/IN the/DT companies/NNS currently/RB earning/VBG very/RB high/JJ yields/NNS are/VBP doing/VBG so/RB through/IN substantial/JJ investment/NN in/IN junk/NN bonds/NNS ,/, and/CC you/PP know/VBP how/WRB nervous/JJ the/DT market/NN has/VBZ been/VBN about/IN those/DT lately/RB ./. 
There/EX are/VBP seemingly/RB endless/JJ twists/NNS to/TO universal/JJ life/NN ,/, and/CC it/PP pays/VBZ to/TO ask/VB questions/NNS about/IN all/DT of/IN them/PP ./.

If/IN interest/NN rates/NNS plunge/VBP ,/, the/DT insurer/NN may/MD be/VB knocking/VBG on/IN my/PP$ door/NN ,/, asking/VBG for/IN steeper/JJR premium/NN payments/NNS to/TO maintain/VB the/DT same/JJ amount/NN of/IN protection/NN ./.

Institutional/JJ investors/NNS have/VBP poured/VBN $/$ 210/CD billion/CD into/IN stock/NN and/CC bond/NN indexing/NN as/IN a/DT cheap/JJ and/CC easy/JJ form/NN of/IN investment/NN management/NN that/WDT promises/VBZ to/TO post/VB average/JJ market/NN returns/NNS ./. 
These/DT big/JJ investors/NNS have/VBP flocked/VBN to/TO indexing/NN because/IN relatively/RB few/JJ ``/`` active/JJ ''/'' stock/NN pickers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO consistently/RB match/VB the/DT returns/NNS of/IN the/DT S&P/NP 500/CD or/CC other/JJ bellwethers/NNS ,/, much/RB less/RBR beat/VB it/PP ./. 
And/CC the/DT fees/NNS investors/NNS pay/VBP for/IN indexing/NN run/VBP a/DT few/JJ pennies/NNS for/IN each/DT $/$ 100/CD of/IN assets/NNS --/: a/DT fraction/NN of/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN active/JJ managers/NNS ./. 
That/DT 's/VBZ because/IN computers/NNS do/VBP most/JJS of/IN the/DT work/NN ,/, and/CC low/JJ trading/NN activity/NN keeps/VBZ a/DT lid/NN on/IN commission/NN costs/NNS ./. 
But/CC today/NN ,/, indexing/NN is/VBZ moving/VBG from/IN a/DT passive/NN investment/NN strategy/NN to/TO an/DT increasingly/RB active/JJ one/CD ./. 
Because/IN index-fund/JJ managers/NNS are/VBP no/RB longer/RBR satisfied/VBN with/IN merely/RB being/VBG average/JJ ,/, they/PP have/VBP developed/VBN ``/`` enhanced/VBN ''/'' indexing/NN strategies/NNS that/WDT are/VBP intended/VBN to/TO outperform/JJ the/DT market/NN as/RB much/JJ as/IN three/CD percentage/NN points/NNS ./. 
``/`` Indexing/NN has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT most/RBS single/JJ successful/JJ investment/NN concept/NN in/IN the/DT last/JJ decade/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT index/NN money/NN has/VBZ been/VBN just/RB sort/NN of/IN sitting/VBG there/RB ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Seth/NP M./NP Lynn/NP ,/, president/NN of/IN Axe/NP Core/NP Investors/NP Inc./NP ,/, an/DT indexer/NN based/VBN in/IN Tarrytown/NP ,/, N.Y/NP ./.

''/'' Among/IN the/DT souped-up/JJ indexing/NN strategies/NNS :/: Indexed/JJ portfolios/NNS can/MD be/VB built/VBN around/IN thousands/NNS of/IN stocks/NNS ,/, or/CC just/RB a/DT few/JJ dozen/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN being/VBG restricted/VBN to/TO the/DT S&P/NP 500/CD companies/NNS ./. 
They/PP can/MD ignore/VB the/DT S&P/NP 500/CD stocks/NNS altogether/RB and/CC focus/VB on/IN particular/JJ types/NNS of/IN stocks/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN smaller/JJR companies/NNS ,/, those/DT paying/VBG high/JJ dividends/NNS or/CC companies/NNS in/IN a/DT particular/JJ industry/NN ,/, state/NN or/CC country/NN ./. 
With/IN today/NN 's/POS computer-driven/JJ program/NN trading/NN techniques/NNS ,/, index/NN funds/NNS can/MD trade/VB back/RB and/CC forth/RB between/IN stock-index/JJ futures/NNS and/CC the/DT actual/JJ stocks/NNS making/VBG up/RP indexes/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT S&P/NP 500/CD ./.

One/CD reason/NN for/IN these/DT hybrids/NNS is/VBZ that/DT indexing/NN 's/POS rapid/JJ growth/NN is/VBZ slowing/VBG ,/, particularly/RB for/IN those/DT ``/`` plain/JJ vanilla/NN ''/'' funds/NNS that/WDT mirror/VBP the/DT S*/NP&P/NN 500/CD ./.

For/IN one/CD thing/NN ,/, according/VBG to/TO Mr./NP Daly/NP ,/, the/DT producers/NNS requested/VBD a/DT release/NN in/IN advance/NN ./.

The/DT theory/NN relies/VBZ on/IN three/CD assumptions/NNS :/: 1/LS )/) Voters/NNS can/MD ``/`` buy/VB ''/'' one/CD of/IN two/CD brands/NNS when/WRB they/PP select/VBP their/PP$ political/JJ agents/NNS --/: a/DT Republican/JJ brand/NN that/WDT believes/VBZ in/IN the/DT minimalist/JJ state/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT virtues/NNS of/IN private/JJ markets/NNS over/IN the/DT vices/NNS of/IN public/JJ action/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT Democratic/JJ brand/NN that/WDT believes/VBZ in/IN big/JJ government/NN and/CC in/IN public/JJ intervention/NN to/TO remedy/VB the/DT excesses/NNS attendant/JJ to/TO the/DT pursuit/NN of/IN private/JJ interest/NN ./. 
2/LS )/) Congressional/JJ representatives/NNS have/VBP two/CD basic/JJ responsibilities/NNS while/IN voting/VBG in/IN office/NN --/: dealing/VBG with/IN national/JJ issues/NNS (/( programmatic/JJ actions/NNS such/JJ as/IN casting/VBG roll/NN call/NN votes/NNS on/IN legislation/NN that/WDT imposes/VBZ costs/NNS and\/CC confers/VBZ benefits/NNS on/IN the/DT population/NN at/IN large/JJ )/) and/CC attending/VBG to/TO local/JJ issues/NNS (/( constituency/NN service/NN and/CC pork/NN barrel/NN )/) ./. 
3/LS )/) Republican/JJ congressional/JJ representatives/NNS ,/, because/IN of/IN their/PP$ belief/NN in/IN a/DT minimalist/JJ state/NN ,/, are/VBP less/RBR willing/JJ to/TO engage/VB in/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN than/IN are/VBP Democratic/JJ members/NNS of/IN Congress/NP ./. 
If/IN these/DT assumptions/NNS hold/VBP ,/, voters/NNS in/IN races/NNS for/IN Congress/NP face/VBP what/WP in/IN economic/JJ theory/NN is/VBZ called/VBN a/DT prisoner/NN 's/POS dilemma/NN and/CC have/VBP an/DT incentive/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT margin/NN ,/, to/TO lean/VB Democratic/JJ ./. 
If/IN they/PP put/VBP a/DT Republican/NP into/IN office/NN ,/, not/RB only/RB will/MD they/PP acquire/VB less/JJR in/IN terms/NNS of/IN local/JJ benefits/NNS but/CC their/PP$ selected/VBN legislator/NN will/MD be/VB relatively/RB powerless/JJ to/TO prevent/VB other/JJ legislators/NNS from/IN ``/`` bringing/VBG home/NN the/DT bacon/NN ''/'' to/TO their/PP$ respective/JJ constituencies/NNS ./. 
Each/DT legislator/NN ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, is/VBZ only/RB one/CD out/IN of/IN 535/CD when/WRB it/PP comes/VBZ to/TO national/JJ policy/NN making/NN ./. 
In/IN races/NNS for/IN the/DT White/NP House/NP ,/, a/DT voter/NN 's/POS incentive/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT margin/NN ,/, is/VBZ to/TO lean/VB Republican/NP ./. 
Although/IN a/DT GOP/NP president/NN may/MD limit/VB local/JJ benefits/NNS to/TO the/DT voter/NN 's/POS particular/JJ district\/state/NN ,/, such/JJ a/DT president/NN is/VBZ also/RB likely/JJ to/TO be/VB more/RBR effective/JJ at/IN preventing/VBG other/JJ districts\/states/NNS and/CC their/PP$ legislators/NNS from/IN bringing/VBG home/NN the/DT local/JJ benefits/NNS ./. 
The/DT individual/JJ voter/NN 's/VBZ standing/NN consequently/RB will/MD be/VB enhanced/VBN through/IN lower/JJR taxes/NNS ./. 
While/IN this/DT theory/NN is/VBZ exceedingly/RB simple/JJ ,/, it/PP appears/VBZ to/TO explain/VB several/JJ things/NNS ./. 
First/JJ ,/, why/WRB ticket/NN splitting/NN has/VBZ increased/VBN and/CC taken/VBN the/DT peculiar/JJ pattern/NN that/IN it/PP has/VBZ over/IN the/DT past/JJ half/JJ century/NN :/: Prior/RB to/TO the/DT election/NN of/IN Franklin/NP Roosevelt/NP as/IN president/NN and/CC the/DT advent/NN of/IN the/DT New/NP Deal/NP ,/, government/NN occupied/VBD a/DT much/RB smaller/JJR role/NN in/IN society/NN and/CC the/DT prisoner/NN 's/POS dilemma/NN problem/NN confronting/VBG voters/NNS in/IN races/NNS for/IN Congress/NP was/VBD considerably/RB less/RBR severe/JJ ./. 
Second/JJ ,/, it/PP explains/VBZ why/WRB voters/NNS hold/VBP Congress/NP in/IN disdain/NN but/CC generally/RB love/VBP their/PP$ own/JJ congressional/JJ representatives/NNS :/: Any/DT individual/JJ legislator/NN 's/POS constituents/NNS appreciate/VBP the/DT specific/JJ benefits/NNS that/IN the/DT legislator/NN wins/VBZ for/IN them/PP but/CC not/RB the/DT overall/JJ cost/NN associated/VBN with/IN every/DT other/JJ legislator/NN doing/VBG likewise/RB for/IN his/PP$ own/JJ constituency/NN ./. 
Third/JJ ,/, the/DT theory/NN suggests/VBZ why/WRB legislators/NNS who/WP pay/VBP too/RB much/JJ attention/NN to/TO national/JJ policy/NN making/NN relative/JJ to/TO local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN have/VBP lower/JJR security/NN in/IN office/NN ./. 
For/IN example/NN ,/, first-term/JJ members/NNS of/IN the/DT House/NN ,/, once/RB the/DT most/RBS vulnerable/JJ of/IN incumbents/NNS ,/, have/VBP become/VBN virtually/RB immune/JJ to/TO defeat/VB ./. 
The/DT one/CD exception/NN to/TO this/DT recent/JJ trend/NN was/VBD the/DT defeat/NN of/IN 13/CD of/IN the/DT 52/CD freshman/NN Republicans/NNS brought/VBD into/IN office/NN in/IN 1980/CD by/IN the/DT Reagan/NP revolution/NN and/CC running/VBG for/IN re-election/NN in/IN 1982/CD ./. 
Because/IN these/DT freshmen/NNS placed/VBD far/RB more/JJR emphasis/NN on/IN their/PP$ partisan/JJ role/NN --/: spreading/VBG the/DT Reagan/NP revolution/NN --/: in/IN national/JJ policy/NN making/VBG ,/, they/PP were/VBD more/RBR vulnerable/JJ to/TO defeat/VB ./. 
Fourth/JJ ,/, the/DT theory/NN indicates/VBZ why/WRB the/DT Republican/NP Party/NP may/MD have/VB a/DT difficult/JJ time/NN attracting/VBG viable/JJ candidates/NNS for/IN congressional/JJ office/NN ./. 
Potential/JJ candidates/NNS may/MD be/VB discouraged/VBN from/IN running/VBG less/RBR by/IN the/DT congressional/JJ salary/NN than/IN by/IN the/DT prospect/NN of/IN defeat/NN at/IN the/DT hands/NNS of/IN a/DT Democratic/JJ opponent/NN ./. 
To/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN potential/JJ Republican/NP candidates/NNS and/CC their/PP$ financial/JJ backers/NNS realize/VBP that/IN the/DT congressional/JJ prisoner/NN 's/POS dilemma/NN game/NN works/VBZ to/TO their/PP$ disadvantage/NN ,/, the/DT Republican/NP Party/NP will/MD be/VB hindered/VBN in/IN its/PP$ attempts/NNS to/TO field/VB a/DT competitive/JJ slate/NN of/IN congressional/JJ candidates/NNS ./. 
Fifth/JJ ,/, the/DT theory/NN may/MD provide/VB at/IN least/JJS a/DT partial/JJ reason/NN for/IN why/WRB ticket/NN splitting/NN has/VBZ been/VBN particularly/RB pronounced/VBN in/IN the/DT South/NP ./. 
To/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN Democratic/JJ legislators/NNS from/IN the/DT South/NP have/VBP held/VBN a/DT disproportionate/JJ share/NN of/IN power/NN in/IN Congress/NP since/IN 1932/CD and/CC have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO translate/VB such/JJ clout/NN into/IN relatively/RB more/JJR local/JJ benefits/NNS for/IN their/PP$ respective/JJ constituencies/NNS ,/, voters/NNS in/IN the/DT South/NP have/VBP had/VBD an/DT especially/RB strong/JJ incentive/NN to/TO keep/VB such/JJ Democrats/NNS in/IN office/NN ./. 
Finally/RB ,/, the/DT theory/NN suggests/VBZ why/WRB Republicans/NNS generally/RB have/VBP fared/VBN better/RBR in/IN Senate/NP races/NNS than/IN in/IN campaigns/NNS for/IN the/DT House/NP ./. 
Since/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN matters/VBZ more/RBR and/CC national/JJ policy/NN making/NN matters/VBZ less/RBR in/IN the/DT lower/JJR chamber/NN of/IN Congress/NP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT pattern/NN one/PP would/MD expect/VB if/IN Republicans/NNS are/VBP less/RBR willing/JJ to/TO engage/VB in/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN than/IN their/PP$ Democratic/JJ counterparts/NNS ./. 
Is/VBZ there/EX any/DT empirical/JJ support/NN for/IN this/DT theory/NN ?/. 
Three/CD pieces/NNS of/IN evidence/NN corroborate/VBP the/DT key/JJ assumption/NN that/IN Democratic/JJ legislators/NNS are/VBP more/RBR willing/JJ to/TO engage/VB in/IN local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN than/IN their/PP$ Republican/JJ colleagues/NNS ./. 
First/JJ ,/, economists/NNS James/NP Bennett/NP and/CC Thomas/NP DiLorenzo/NP find/VBP that/IN GOP/NP senators/NNS turn/VBP back/RB roughly/RB 10/CD %/NN more/JJR of/IN their/PP$ allocated/VBN personal/JJ staff/NN budgets/NNS than/IN Democrats/NNS do/VBP ./. 
To/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN the/DT primary/JJ duty/NN of/IN personal/JJ staff/NN involves/VBZ local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN ,/, this/DT indicates/VBZ that/IN political/JJ philosophy/NN leads/VBZ congressional/JJ Republicans/NNS to/TO pay/VB less/JJR attention/NN to/TO narrow/JJ constituent/NN concerns/NNS ./. 
Second/JJ ,/, if/IN the/DT key/JJ assumption/NN is/VBZ valid/JJ ,/, Democrats/NNS should/MD have/VB lower/JJR attendance/NN rates/NNS on/IN roll-call/NN votes/NNS than/IN Republicans/NNS do/VBP to/TO the/DT extent/NN that/IN such/JJ votes/NNS reflect/VBP national/JJ policy/NN making/NN and/CC that/IN participating/VBG in/IN such/JJ votes/NNS takes/VBZ away/RB from/IN the/DT time/NN a/DT legislator/NN could/MD otherwise/RB devote/VB to/TO local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ indeed/RB what/WP the/DT data/NNS indicate/VBP ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN the/DT House/NP ./. 
The/DT Democratic/JJ House/NP attendance/NN rate/NN has/VBZ not/RB exceeded/VBN the/DT Republican/JJ House/NP attendance/NN rate/NN since/IN 1959/CD ./. 
Finally/RB ,/, as/IN shown/VBN in/IN the/DT table/NN ,/, Democrats/NNS allocate/VBP a/DT higher/JJR proportion/NN of/IN their/PP$ personal/JJ staffs/NNS to/TO district/NN offices/NNS --/: where/WRB local/JJ benefit-seeking/NN duties/NNS matter/VBP more/RBR and/CC national/JJ policy/NN making/NN activities/NNS matter/VBP less/RBR relative/JJ to/TO Washington/NP offices/NNS ./. 
An/DT examination/NN of/IN changes/NNS in/IN personal/JJ staffing/NN decisions/NNS in/IN the/DT Senate/NP between/IN 1986/CD and/CC 1987/CD (/( when/WRB control/NN of/IN that/DT body/NN changed/VBD party/NN hands/NNS )/) ,/, moreover/RB ,/, reveals/VBZ that/IN the/DT personal/JJ staffing/NN differences/NNS noted/VBN in/IN the/DT table/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB attributed/VBN to/TO the/DT disproportionate/JJ control/NN Democrats/NNS exercise/VBP ,/, due/JJ to/TO their/PP$ majority-party/JJ status/NN ,/, over/IN other/JJ resources/NNS such/JJ as/IN committee/NN staff/NN ./. 
An/DT additional/JJ piece/NN of/IN evidence/NN from/IN the/DT Senate/NP :/: Holding/VBG other/JJ factors/NNS constant/JJ ,/, such/JJ as/IN incumbency/NN advantages/NNS and/CC regional/JJ factors/NNS ,/, the/DT difference/NN between/IN popular/JJ votes/NNS for/IN Republican/JJ presidential/JJ and/CC senatorial/JJ candidates/NNS in/IN states/NNS conducting/VBG a/DT Senate/NP election/NN turns/VBZ out/RP to/TO be/VB a/DT positive/JJ function/NN of/IN how/WRB onerous/JJ the/DT federal/JJ government/NN 's/POS tax/NN burden/NN is/VBZ per/IN state/NN (/( a/DT progressive/JJ tax/NN rate/NN hits/VBZ higher-income/JJ states/NNS harder/RBR )/) ./. 
Put/VB more/RBR simply/JJ ,/, GOP/NP candidates/NNS for/IN president/NN are/VBP looked/VBN on/IN more/RBR kindly/RB by/IN voters/NNS than/IN Republican/JJ candidates/NNS for/IN the/DT Senate/NP when/WRB the/DT prisoner/NN 's/POS dilemma/NN is/VBZ more/RBR severe/JJ ./. 
Moreover/RB ,/, ticket/NN splitting/NN appears/VBZ to/TO take/VB the/DT same/JJ peculiar/JJ pattern/NN at/IN the/DT state/NN government/NN level/NN as/IN it/PP does/VBZ at/IN the/DT federal/JJ level/NN ./. 
State/NN government/NN is/VBZ more/RBR typically/RB split/VBN along/IN Republican-governor\/JJ lines/NNS than/IN the/DT reverse/NN ./. 
A/DT cross-state/JJ econometric/JJ investigation/NN ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, reveals/VBZ that/IN ,/, holding/VBG other/JJ factors/NNS constant/JJ ,/, the/DT difference/NN between/IN a/DT state/NN 's/POS major-party/JJ vote/NN going/VBG to/TO the/DT Republican/JJ gubernatorial/JJ candidate/NN and/CC the/DT Republican/JJ share/NN of/IN the/DT lower/JJR state/NN house/NN is/VBZ a/DT positive/JJ function/NN of/IN the/DT state/NN tax/NN rate/NN ./. 
In/IN sum/NN ,/, at/IN both/DT the/DT federal/JJ and/CC state/NN government/NN levels/NNS at/IN least/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT seemingly/RB irrational/JJ behavior/NN voters/NNS display/VBP in/IN the/DT voting/NN booth/NN may/MD have/VB an/DT exceedingly/RB rational/JJ explanation/NN ./.

Both/DT can/MD be/VB expected/VBN to/TO go/VB after/IN the/DT market/NN aggressively/RB :/: Gartner/NP Group/NP Inc./NP ,/, a/DT research/NN firm/NN ,/, estimated/VBD the/DT Digital/NP gets/VBZ 30/CD %/NN of/IN its/PP$ revenue/NN from/IN the/DT manufacturing/VBG market/NN ,/, and/CC Hewlett-Packard/NP gets/VBZ 50/CD %/NN ./.

Mr./NP Gras/NP said/VBD the/DT joint/JJ venture/NN represents/VBZ considerable/JJ savings/NNS for/IN both/DT Renault/NP and/CC DAF/NP ,/, since/IN both/DT companies/NNS would/MD in/IN any/DT case/NN have/VB had/VBN to/TO renew/VB their/PP$ existing/VBG ranges/NNS of/IN light/JJ goods/NNS vehicles/NNS ./.

The/DT van/NP Doorne/NP family/NN of/IN the/DT Netherlands/NP holds/VBZ an/DT additional/JJ 11/CD %/NN of/IN DAF/NP 's/POS capital/NN ./. 
The/DT Federal/NP Reserve/NP System/NP is/VBZ the/DT standard/JJ object/NN of/IN suggestions/NNS for/IN organizational/JJ and/CC institutional/JJ changes/NNS ,/, for/IN two/CD reasons/NNS ./. 
First/JJ ,/, its/PP$ position/NN in/IN the/DT government/NN is/VBZ anomalous/JJ ./. 
It/PP has/VBZ an/DT unusual/JJ kind/NN of/IN independence/NN from/IN elected/VBN officials/NNS and/CC still/RB has/VBZ authority/NN over/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS powerful/JJ of/IN government/NN 's/POS instruments/NNS --/: the/DT control/NN of/IN the/DT money/NN supply/NN ./. 
Thus/RB we/PP have/VBP a/DT condition/NN that/WDT is/VBZ easily/RB described/VBN as/IN undemocratic/JJ ./. 
Second/JJ ,/, the/DT responsibilities/NNS of/IN the/DT Federal/NP Reserve/NP as/IN guardian/NN of/IN the/DT currency/NN ,/, which/WDT means/VBZ as/IN guardian/NN of/IN the/DT stability/NN of/IN the/DT price/NN level/NN ,/, sometimes/RB lead/VBP it/PP to/TO take/VB measures/NNS that/WDT are/VBP unpopular/JJ ./. 
As/IN former/JJ Fed/NP Chairman/NP William/NP McChesney/NP Martin/NP used/VBD to/TO say/VB ,/, they/PP would/MD have/VB to/TO take/VB the/DT punch/NN bowl/NN away/RB just/RB as/IN the/DT party/NN is/VBZ getting/VBG interesting/JJ ./. 
So/IN the/DT Federal/NP Reserve/NP is/VBZ an/DT attractive/JJ target/NN for/IN complaint/NN by/IN politicians/NNS ./. 
The/DT Fed/NP is/VBZ easily/RB assigned/VBN the/DT blame/NN for/IN unpleasantness/NN ,/, like/IN high/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS or/CC slow/JJ economic/JJ growth/NN ,/, while/IN the/DT politicians/NNS can/MD escape/VB responsibility/NN by/IN pointing/VBG to/TO the/DT Fed/NP 's/POS independence/NN ./. 
This/DT leads/VBZ to/TO proposals/NNS for/IN ``/`` reform/NN ''/'' of/IN the/DT Fed/NP ,/, which/WDT have/VBP the/DT common/JJ feature/NN of/IN making/VBG the/DT Fed/NP more/RBR responsive/JJ to/TO the/DT administration/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT Congress/NP and/CC to/TO public/JJ opinion/NN --/: without/IN ,/, however/RB ,/, any/DT assumption/NN of/IN additional/JJ responsibility/NN by/IN the/DT politicians/NNS ./. 
These/DT proposals/NNS include/VBP changing/VBG the/DT term/NN of/IN the/DT chairman/NN ,/, shortening/VBG the/DT terms/NNS of/IN the/DT members/NNS ,/, eliminating/VBG the/DT presidents/NNS of/IN the/DT Federal/NP Reserve/NP Banks/NPS from/IN the/DT decision-making/JJ process/NN ,/, putting/VBG the/DT Secretary/NP of/IN the/DT Treasury/NP on/IN the/DT Federal/NP Reserve/NP Board/NP ,/, having/VBG the/DT Fed/NP audited/VBD by/IN an/DT arm/NN of/IN Congress/NP (/( the/DT General/NP Accounting/NP Office/NP )/) ,/, putting/VBG the/DT Fed/NP 's/POS expenditures/NNS in/IN the/DT budget/NN ,/, and/CC requiring/VBG prompt/JJ publication/NN of/IN the/DT Fed/NP 's/POS minutes/NNS ./. 
Some/DT of/IN these/DT ideas/NNS are/VBP again/RB under/IN consideration/NN in/IN Congress/NP ./. 
But/CC these/DT proposals/NNS do/VBP not/RB rest/VB on/IN a/DT view/NN of/IN what/WP the/DT Fed/NP 's/POS problem/NN is/VBZ or/CC ,/, if/IN they/PP do/VBP ,/, they/PP rest/VBP on/IN an/DT incorrect/JJ view/NN ./. 
They/PP would/MD not/RB solve/VB the/DT problem/NN ;/: they/PP would/MD make/VB it/PP worse/JJR ./. 
The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/IN the/DT Fed/NP is/VBZ too/RB unresponsive/JJ to/TO the/DT public/JJ interest/NN ./. 
On/IN the/DT contrary/NN ,/, it/PP is/VBZ too/RB responsive/JJ to/TO an/DT incorrect/JJ view/NN of/IN the/DT public/JJ interest/NN ./. 
The/DT price/NN level/NN in/IN the/DT U.S./NP is/VBZ now/RB about/IN 4/CD 1\/4/CD times/NNS as/RB high/RB as/IN it/PP was/VBD 30/CD years/NNS ago/IN ./. 
On/IN average/NN ,/, something/NN that/WDT cost/VBD $/$ 100/CD 30/CD years/NNS ago/IN now/RB costs/VBZ $/$ 425/CD ./. 
Or/CC ,/, a/DT wage/NN that/WDT was/VBD $/$ 100/CD 30/CD years/NNS ago/IN would/MD buy/VB only/RB $/$ 23.53/CD worth/NN of/IN stuff/NN today/NN ./. 
On/IN two/CD occasions/NNS the/DT inflation/NN rate/NN rose/VBD to/TO more/JJR than/IN 10/CD %/NN a/DT year/NN ./. 
In/IN each/DT case/NN the/DT ending/NN of/IN this/DT unsustainable/JJ inflation/NN caused/VBD a/DT severe/JJ recession/NN --/: the/DT two/CD worst/JJS of/IN the/DT postwar/JJ period/NN ./. 
The/DT enormous/JJ inflation/NN over/IN the/DT past/JJ 30/CD years/NNS was/VBD largely/RB due/JJ to/TO monetary/JJ policy/NN ./. 
At/IN least/JJS ,/, it/PP would/MD not/RB have/VB happened/VBN without/IN the/DT support/NN of/IN monetary/JJ policy/NN that/WDT provided/VBD for/IN a/DT 10-fold/JJ increase/NN in/IN the/DT money/NN supply/NN during/IN the/DT same/JJ period/NN ./. 
And/CC that/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT money/NN supply/NN would/MD not/RB have/VB happened/VBN without/IN the/DT consent/NN of/IN the/DT Federal/NP Reserve/NP ./. 
The/DT basic/JJ problem/NN of/IN monetary/JJ policy/NN ,/, to/TO which/WDT reform/NN of/IN the/DT Fed/NP should/MD be/VB addressed/VBN ,/, is/VBZ to/TO prevent/VB a/DT recurrence/NN of/IN this/DT experience/NN ./. 
There/EX were/VBD two/CD general/JJ reasons/NNS for/IN the/DT mistaken/JJ monetary/JJ policy/NN of/IN the/DT past/JJ 30/CD years/NNS :/: 1/CD ./. 
To/TO some/DT extent/NN the/DT Federal/NP Reserve/NP shared/VBD the/DT popular/JJ but/CC incorrect/JJ view/NN that/IN expansionary/JJ monetary/JJ policy/NN could/MD yield/VB a/DT net/JJ improvement/NN in/IN employment/NN and/CC output/NN ./. 
2/CD ./. 
Even/RB where/WRB the/DT Fed/NP did/VBD not/RB share/VB this/DT view/NN it/PP felt/VBD the/DT need/NN to/TO accommodate/VB to/TO it/PP ./. 
Despite/IN all/PDT the/DT formal/JJ provisions/NNS for/IN its/PP$ independence/NN ,/, the/DT Fed/NP seems/VBZ constantly/RB to/TO feel/VB that/IN if/IN it/PP uses/VBZ its/PP$ independence/NN too/RB freely/RB it/PP will/MD lose/VB it/PP ./. 
The/DT common/JJ proposals/NNS for/IN reforming/VBG the/DT Fed/NP would/MD only/RB make/VB the/DT situation/NN worse/JJR ,/, if/IN they/PP had/VBD any/DT effect/NN at/IN all/DT ./. 
Putting/VBG the/DT Secretary/NP of/IN the/DT Treasury/NP on/IN the/DT Board/NP of/IN Governors/NP ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT leading/VBG proposals/NNS today/NN ,/, is/VBZ an/DT example/NN ./. 
The/DT secretary/NN is/VBZ the/DT world/NN 's/POS biggest/JJS borrower/NN of/IN money/NN ./. 
He/PP has/VBZ a/DT built-in/NN ,/, constant/JJ longing/NN for/IN lower/JJR interest/NN rates/NNS ./. 
Moreover/RB ,/, he/PP is/VBZ a/DT political/JJ agent/NN of/IN a/DT political/JJ president/NN ,/, who/WP naturally/RB gives/VBZ extraordinary/JJ weight/NN to/TO the/DT way/NN the/DT economy/NN will/MD perform/VB before/IN the/DT next/JJ election/NN ,/, and/CC less/JJR to/TO its/PP$ longer-run/JJ health/NN ./. 
These/DT days/NNS ,/, the/DT secretary/NN suffers/VBZ the/DT further/JJ disqualification/NN that/IN he/PP is/VBZ a/DT member/NN of/IN a/DT club/NN of/IN seven/CD finance/NN ministers/NNS who/WP meet/VBP occasionally/RB to/TO decide/VB what/WP exchange/NN rates/NNS should/MD be/VB ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT diversion/NN from/IN the/DT real/JJ business/NN of/IN the/DT Federal/NP Reserve/NP to/TO stabilize/VB the/DT price/NN level/NN ./. 
How/WRB should/MD a/DT reasonable/JJ member/NN of/IN the/DT Federal/NP Reserve/NP Board/NP interpret/VB a/DT congressional/JJ decision/NN to/TO put/VB the/DT secretary/NN on/IN the/DT board/NN ?/. 
Could/MD he/PP plausibly/RB interpret/VB it/PP as/IN encouragement/NN for/IN the/DT Fed/NP to/TO give/VB primary/JJ emphasis/NN to/TO stabilizing/VBG the/DT price/NN level/NN ?/. 
Or/CC would/MD he/PP interpret/VB it/PP as/IN instruction/NN to/TO give/VB more/JJR weight/NN to/TO these/DT other/JJ objectives/NNS that/IN the/DT secretary/NN represents/VBZ --/: low/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS ,/, short-run/JJ economic/JJ expansion/NN ,/, and/CC stabilization/NN of/IN exchange/NN rates/NNS at/IN internationally/RB managed/VBN levels/NNS ?/. 
The/DT answer/NN seems/VBZ perfectly/RB clear/JJ ./. 
(/( True/JJ ,/, a/DT succession/NN of/IN Fed/NP chairmen/NNS has/VBZ given/VBN color/NN to/TO the/DT notion/NN that/IN the/DT Secretary/NP of/IN the/DT Treasury/NP belongs/VBZ on/IN the/DT Fed/NP ./. 
By/IN their/PP$ constant/JJ readiness/NN to/TO advise/VB all/DT and/CC sundry/JJ about/IN federal/JJ budgetary/JJ matters/NNS the/DT chairmen/NNS have/VBP encouraged/VBN the/DT belief/NN that/DT fiscal/JJ policy/NN and/CC monetary/JJ policy/NN are/VBP ingredients/NNS of/IN a/DT common/JJ stew/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT case/NN it/PP is/VBZ natural/JJ that/IN the/DT Fed/NP and/CC the/DT Treasury/NP ,/, and/CC probably/RB also/RB the/DT Congress/NP ,/, should/MD be/VB jointly/RB engaged/VBN in/IN stirring/VBG the/DT pot/NN ./.

)/) The/DT Fed/NP 's/POS problem/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/IN it/PP is/VBZ too/RB independent/JJ ,/, or/CC too/RB unpolitical/JJ ./. 
The/DT Fed/NP is/VBZ responsive/JJ to/TO ,/, and/CC can/MD not/RB help/VB being/VBG responsive/JJ to/TO ,/, the/DT more/JJR overtly/RB political/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT government/NN ./. 
The/DT Fed/NP exercises/VBZ a/DT power/NN given/VBN to/TO it/PP by/IN Congress/NP and/CC the/DT president/NN ./. 
But/CC Congress/NP and/CC the/DT president/NN accept/VBP no/DT responsibility/NN for/IN the/DT exercise/NN of/IN the/DT power/NN they/PP have/VBP given/VBN the/DT Fed/NP ./. 
Critics/NNS of/IN the/DT present/JJ arrangement/NN are/VBP correct/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN it/PP is/VBZ undemocratic/JJ ./. 
What/WP is/VBZ undemocratic/JJ is/VBZ the/DT unwillingness/NN of/IN the/DT more/RBR political/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT government/NN to/TO take/VB the/DT responsibility/NN for/IN deciding/VBG the/DT basic/JJ question/NN of/IN monetary/JJ policy/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ what/WDT priority/NN should/MD be/VB given/VBN to/TO stabilizing/VBG the/DT price/NN level/NN ./. 
To/TO leave/VB this/DT decision/NN to/TO an/DT ``/`` independent/JJ ''/'' agency/NN is/VBZ not/RB only/RB undemocratic/JJ ./. 
It/PP also/RB prevents/VBZ the/DT conduct/NN of/IN a/DT policy/NN that/WDT has/VBZ a/DT long-term/JJ rationale/NN ,/, because/IN it/PP leaves/VBZ the/DT Fed/NP guessing/VBG about/IN what/WP are/VBP the/DT expectations/NNS of/IN its/PP$ masters/NNS ,/, the/DT politicians/NNS ,/, who/WP have/VBP never/RB had/VBN to/TO consider/VB the/DT long-term/JJ consequences/NNS of/IN monetary/JJ policy/NN ./.

Under/IN current/JJ rules/NNS ,/, that/DT accrued/VBN interest/NN is/VBZ deductible/JJ by/IN the/DT company/NN issuing/VBG the/DT debt/NN ./.

The/DT bill/NN would/MD then/RB declare/VB that/IN the/DT debt/NN is/VBZ equity/NN and/CC therefore/RB is/VBZ n't/RB deductible/JJ ./. 
The/DT Senate/NP bill/NN would/MD only/RB deny/VB the/DT deduction/NN until/IN interest/NN is/VBZ actually/RB paid/VBN ./. 
Currently/RB ,/, even/RB though/IN the/DT issuer/NN does/VBZ n't/RB pay/VB tax/NN ,/, the/DT debt/NN holder/NN is/VBZ taxed/VBN on/IN the/DT accrued/VBN interest/NN ./.

Part/NN of/IN the/DT answer/NN lies/VBZ in/IN the/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT industry/NN ./. 
Many/JJ larger/JJR egg/NN producers/NNS are/VBP also/RB egg/NN processors/NNS ,/, who/WP crack/VBP ,/, inspect/VBP ,/, and/CC sanitize/VBP billions/NNS of/IN eggs/NNS ,/, turning/VBG them/PP into/IN powdered/JJ ,/, liquified/JJ or/CC frozen/JJ egg/NN products/NNS ./.

The/DT idea/NN behind/IN the/DT Egg/NP King/NP is/VBZ pretty/JJ simple/NN :/: put/VB the/DT eggs/NNS into/IN a/DT cylinder/NN that/WDT contains/VBZ perforated/JJ baskets/NNS ,/, spin/VB them/PP at/IN a/DT high/JJ speed/NN to/TO break/VB the/DT shells/NNS and/CC strain/VB the/DT edible/JJ part/NN through/IN the/DT baskets/NNS ./.

Such/JJ centrifugal/JJ egg/NN breakers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN around/IN since/IN the/DT 1890s/NNS ./. 
But/CC when/WRB Mr./NP Maynard/NP came/VBD forward/RB with/IN his/PP$ machine/NN in/IN the/DT early/JJ 1970s/NNS nobody/NN else/JJ was/VBD offering/VBG them/PP in/IN the/DT U.S/NP ./.

Hens/NNS sometimes/RB pass/VBP salmonella/NN to/TO the/DT eggs/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PP can/MD also/RB be/VB found/VBN on/IN unclean/JJ shells/NNS ./. 
Thus/RB ,/, any/DT machine/NN that/WDT breaks/VBZ large/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN eggs/NNS at/IN once/RB has/VBZ the/DT potential/NN to/TO spread/VB salmonella/NN if/IN a/DT bad/JJ egg/NN gets/VBZ in/IN with/IN the/DT good/JJ ones/NNS ./. 
Mr./NP Maynard/NP claims/VBZ this/DT is/VBZ a/DT manageable/JJ problem/NN ./. 
The/DT Egg/NP King/NP carries/VBZ written/JJ instructions/NNS to/TO break/VB only/JJ high-grade/JJ eggs/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN properly/RB sanitized/VBN and/CC ,/, as/IN an/DT added/VBN precaution/NN ,/, to/TO use/VB the/DT eggs/NNS only/RB in/IN products/NNS that/WDT will/MD be/VB cooked/VBN enough/RB to/TO kill/VB bacteria/NNS ./.

Of/IN course/NN ,/, it/PP does/VBZ n't/RB hurt/VB that/IN Mr./NP Kloves/NP has/VBZ made/VBN up/RB for/IN his/PP$ lack/NN of/IN experience/NN behind/IN the/DT camera/NN with/IN technicians/NNS who/WP know/VBP exactly/RB what/WP they/PP 're/VBP doing/VBG ./.
