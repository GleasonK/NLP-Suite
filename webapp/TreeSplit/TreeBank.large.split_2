Mr./NP Bork/NP 's/POS opponents/NNS chose/VBD the/DT battlefield/NN ,/, held/VBD it/PP and/CC kept/VBD it/PP ./.

Still/RB ,/, the/DT long/JJ view/NN of/IN Robert/NP Bork/NP as/IN constitutional/JJ thinker/NN must/MD be/VB a/DT spotty/JJ one/CD ./. 
His/PP$ strength/NN lies/VBZ in/IN his/PP$ majoritarian/JJ doctrine/NN ,/, which/WDT keeps/VBZ the/DT Court/NP clear/JJ of/IN transient/JJ group/NN pressures/NNS and/CC leaves/VBZ most/JJS decisions/NNS in/IN a/DT democracy/NN to/TO elected/JJ legislatures/NNS and/CC executives/NNS ./.

The/DT question/NN of/IN segregated/JJ schools/NNS ,/, in/IN Brown/NP vs./IN Board/NP of/IN Education/NP ,/, was/VBD such/PDT an/DT issue/NN ./. 
In/IN our/PP$ time/NN abortion/NN has/VBZ become/VBN another/DT ,/, best/RBS left/VBN to/TO a/DT line/NN of/IN Supreme/NP Court/NP decisions/NNS rather/RB than/IN to/TO the/DT chaos/NN of/IN 50/CD state/NN legislatures/NNS ./.

One/PP can/MD understand/VB Mr./NP Bork/NP 's/POS fear/NN that/IN the/DT new/JJ right/NN to/TO privacy/NN will/MD become/VB intolerably/RB stretched/VBN ,/, though/IN a/DT Supreme/NP Court/NP composed/VBN of/IN men/NNS and/CC women/NNS with/IN realism/NN ,/, guts/NNS and/CC a/DT sense/NN of/IN limits/NNS should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO manage/VB it/PP ./. 
What/WP is/VBZ certain/JJ is/VBZ that/IN if/IN Americans/NPS allow/VBP another/DT happening/NN like/IN the/DT degrading/JJ Bork/NP confirmation/NN circus/NN ,/, it/PP will/MD be/VB at/IN their/PP$ peril/NN ./.

--/: If/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN the/DT stock/NN declines/VBZ ,/, the/DT put/NN will/MD increase/VB in/IN value/NN ./. 
Once/IN the/DT stock/NN price/NN is/VBZ less/JJR than/IN the/DT exercise/NN price/NN ,/, or/CC ``/`` strike/NN price/NN ,/, ''/'' of/IN the/DT put/NN ,/, the/DT gain/NN will/MD match/VB the/DT loss/NN on/IN the/DT stock/NN dollar/NN for/IN dollar/NN ./. 
The/DT put/NN establishes/VBZ a/DT minimum/NN selling/NN price/NN for/IN the/DT stock/NN during/IN its/PP$ life/NN ./. 
When/WRB a/DT stock/NN falls/VBZ below/IN the/DT put/NN 's/POS strike/NN price/NN ,/, the/DT investor/NN simply/RB sells/VBZ the/DT stock/NN at/IN a/DT loss/NN and/CC simultaneously/RB sells/VBZ the/DT put/NN at/IN a/DT profit/NN ./.

The/DT accompanying/JJ table/NN shows/VBZ how/WRB this/DT strategy/NN would/MD work/VB for/IN three/CD stocks/NNS ./. 
Though/IN not/RB reflected/VBN in/IN the/DT table/NN ,/, an/DT investor/NN should/MD know/VB that/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT option/NN insurance/NN can/MD be/VB partially/RB offset/VBN by/IN any/DT dividends/NNS that/WDT the/DT stock/NN pays/VBZ ./. 
For/IN example/NN ,/, Tenneco/NP Inc./NP pays/VBZ a/DT quarterly/JJ dividend/NN of/IN 76/CD cents/NNS ,/, which/WDT would/MD be/VB received/VBN before/IN the/DT February/NP option/NN expires/VBZ and/CC ,/, thus/RB ,/, reduce/VB the/DT cost/NN of/IN using/VBG the/DT technique/NN by/IN that/DT amount/NN ./. 
In/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT investor/NN 's/POS risk/NN would/MD n't/RB exceed/VB 3.6/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT total/JJ investment/NN ./. 
To/TO simplify/VB the/DT calculations/NNS ,/, commissions/NNS on/IN the/DT option/NN and/CC underlying/JJ stock/NN are/VBP n't/RB included/VBN in/IN the/DT table/NN ./. 
There/EX are/VBP more/JJR than/IN 650/CD stocks/NNS on/IN which/WDT options/NNS may/MD be/VB bought/VBN and/CC sold/VBN ,/, including/VBG some/DT over-the-counter/JJ stocks/NNS ./.

For/IN instance/NN ,/, the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ index/NN option/NN is/VBZ the/DT S&P/NP 100/CD option/NN ,/, commonly/RB called/VBN the/DT OEX/NP ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT stocks/NNS that/WDT make/VBP up/RP Standard/NP &/CC Poor/NP 's/POS 100-stock/CD index/NN ./. 
Unlike/IN options/NNS on/IN individual/JJ issues/NNS ,/, index/NN options/NNS are/VBP settled/VBN only/RB in/IN cash/NN ,/, and/CC no/DT stock/NN is/VBZ ever/RB tendered/VBN ./. 
But/CC while/IN index/NN options/NNS are/VBP convenient/JJ ,/, they/PP have/VBP several/JJ disadvantages/NNS ./. 
For/IN one/CD thing/NN ,/, an/DT investor/NN 's/POS portfolio/NN might/MD not/RB closely/RB match/VB the/DT S&P/NP 100/CD ./. 
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, the/DT OEX/NP insurance/NN may/MD or/CC may/MD not/RB fully/RB protect/VB an/DT investor/NN 's/POS holdings/NNS in/IN the/DT event/NN of/IN a/DT market/NN decline/NN ./. 
In/IN addition/NN ,/, OEX/NP options/NNS were/VBD suspended/VBN from/IN trading/VBG last/JJ Friday/NP afternoon/NN ,/, after/IN the/DT stock-market/NN sell-off/NN got/VBD under/IN way/NN and/CC trading/NN in/IN the/DT S&P-500/NP futures/NNS contract/NN was/VBD halted/VBN ./. 
So/IN an/DT investor/NN who/WP wanted/VBD to/TO realize/VB a/DT profit/NN on/IN OEX/NP puts/NNS after/IN the/DT trading/NN suspension/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN out/IN of/IN luck/NN ./. 
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, only/RB a/DT handful/NN of/IN individual/JJ issues/NNS were/VBD suspended/VBN from/IN trading/VBG|NN on/IN Friday/NP ./. 
Normally/RB ,/, once/RB the/DT underlying/JJ investment/NN is/VBZ suspended/VBN from/IN trading/VBG|NN ,/, the/DT options/NNS on/IN those/DT investments/NNS also/RB do/VBP n't/RB trade/VB ./. 
Ultimately/RB ,/, whether/IN the/DT insurance/NN provided/VBN by/IN purchasing/VBG puts/NNS is/VBZ worthwhile/JJ depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT options/NNS ./. 
That/DT cost/NN rises/VBZ in/IN times/NNS of/IN high/JJ market/NN volatility/NN ./. 
But/CC it/PP still/RB might/MD be/VB cheaper/JJR than/IN taking/VBG a/DT major/JJ hit/NN ./. 
The/DT protection/NN from/IN using/VBG married/JJ puts/NNS is/VBZ clearly/RB superior/JJ to/TO that/DT afforded/VBN by/IN another/DT options/NNS strategy/NN some/DT investors/NNS consider/VBP using/VBG during/IN troubled/JJ times/NNS :/: selling/VBG call/NN options/NNS on/IN stocks/NNS the/DT investor/NN owns/VBZ ./. 
A/DT call/NN option/NN is/VBZ similar/JJ to/TO a/DT put/NN ,/, except/IN that/IN it/PP gives/VBZ its/PP$ owner/NN the/DT right/NN to/TO buy/VB shares/NNS at/IN a/DT stated/JJ price/NN until/IN expiration/NN ./. 
Selling/VBG a/DT call/NN option/NN gives/VBZ an/DT investor/NN a/DT small/JJ buffer/NN against/IN a/DT stock-market/NN decline/NN ./. 
That/DT 's/VBZ because/IN it/PP reduces/VBZ the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT stock/NN by/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN premium/NN received/VBN from/IN the/DT sale/NN of/IN the/DT call/NN ./. 
But/CC if/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN the/DT stock/NN rises/VBZ above/IN the/DT strike/NN price/NN of/IN the/DT option/NN ,/, the/DT stock/NN is/VBZ almost/RB certain/JJ to/TO be/VB called/VBN away/RP ./. 
And/CC in/IN that/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT investor/NN misses/VBZ out/RP on/IN any/DT major/JJ upside/JJ gain./NN drop/NN ,/, but/CC shrinks/VBZ the/DT return/NN if/IN stock/NN prices/NNS rise/VBP ./. 
These/DT calculations/NNS exclude/VBP the/DT effect/NN of/IN commissions/NNS paid/VBN and/CC dividends/NNS received/VBN from/IN the/DT stock/NN ./. 
All/DT prices/NNS are/VBP as/IN of/IN Monday/NP 's/POS close/NN ./.

The/DT deal/NN was/VBD symbolized/VBN by/IN the/DT restoration/NN of/IN the/DT Shi'ite/NP Sultan/NP Ali/NP Keshtmand/NP to/TO the/DT Afghan/JJ prime/JJ ministry/NN ./. 
Moreover/RB ,/, serious/JJ questions/NNS have/VBP been/VBN raised/VBN about/IN the/DT claimed/VBN withdrawal/NN of/IN Soviet/JJ forces/NNS ./. 
Before/IN his/PP$ assassination/NN in/IN 1988/CD ,/, President/NP Zia/NP of/IN Pakistan/NP repeatedly/RB stated/VBD that/IN fresh/JJ Soviet/JJ troops/NNS were/VBD being/VBG inserted/VBN into/IN Afghanistan/NP even/RB as/IN others/NNS were/VBD ostentatiously/RB withdrawn/VBN ./.

Meanwhile/RB ,/, the/DT Kabul/NP regime/NN is/VBZ increasingly/RB successful/JJ at/IN portraying/VBG the/DT resistance/NN as/IN bloody-minded/JJ fanatics/NNS ./. 
In/IN this/DT they/PP are/VBP aided/VBN by/IN years/NNS of/IN American/JJ ,/, European/JJ ,/, Pakistani/JJ and/CC Saudi/JJ support/NN for/IN the/DT most/RBS extreme/JJ factions/NNS --/: radical/JJ Islamic/JJ fanatics/NNS with/IN leaders/NNS whose/WP$ policies/NNS are/VBP anathema/NN to/TO the/DT Afghan/JJ public/NN ./. 
This/DT heavy/JJ outside/JJ support/NN for/IN the/DT worst/JJS has/VBZ undermined/VBN better/JJR ,/, moderate/JJ leaders/NNS ./. 
In/IN autumn/NN last/JJ year/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT regime/NN garrison/NN at/IN Kandahar/NP was/VBD prepared/VBN to/TO surrender/VB the/DT city/NN to/TO resistance/NN moderates/NNS ./.

The/DT deal/NN fell/VBD through/IN ,/, and/CC Kandahar/NP remains/VBZ a/DT major/JJ regime/NN base/NN ./. 
The/DT resistance/NN lacks/VBZ not/RB only/JJ air/NN power/NN ,/, armor/NN and/CC expertise/NN but/CC often/RB such/JJ essentials/NNS as/IN maps/NNS ,/, mine/NN detectors/NNS ,/, or/CC even/RB winter/NN gloves/NNS ./.

Instead/RB ,/, they/PP were/VBD pressured/JJ by/IN Pakistan/NP 's/POS ISI/NP ,/, the/DT channel/NN for/IN their/PP$ support/NN ,/, into/IN attacking/VBG Jalalabad/NP ./. 
They/PP took/VBD more/RBR than/IN 25/CD %/NN casualties/NNS ;/: journalists/NNS report/VBP that/IN they/PP faced/VBD minefields/NNS without/IN mine/NN detectors/NNS ./. 
The/DT wonder/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/IN the/DT resistance/NN has/VBZ failed/VBN to/TO topple/VB the/DT Kabul/NP regime/NN ,/, but/CC that/IN it/PP continues/VBZ to/TO exist/VB and/CC fight/VB at/IN all/DT ./. 
Last/JJ summer/NN ,/, in/IN response/NN to/TO congressional/JJ criticism/NN ,/, the/DT State/NP Department/NP and/CC the/DT CIA/NP said/VBD they/PP had/VBD resumed/VBN military/JJ aid/NN to/TO the/DT resistance/NN months/NNS after/IN it/PP was/VBD cut/VBN off/IN ;/: but/CC it/PP is/VBZ not/RB clear/JJ how/WRB much/RB is/VBZ being/VBG sent/VBN or/CC when/WRB it/PP will/MD arrive/VB ./.

Arguably/RB ,/, both/DT were/VBD on/IN notice/NN that/IN their/PP$ behavior/NN was/VBD at/IN least/JJS risky/JJ ./. 
But/CC even/RB if/IN they/PP behaved/VBD recklessly/RB ,/, reasons/NNS still/RB exist/VBP to/TO fear/VB and/CC resist/VB this/DT steady/JJ process/NN of/IN case-by-case/JJ judicial/JJ extension/NN of/IN the/DT law/NN of/IN insider/NN trading/NN ./. 
Courts/NNS and/CC legislatures/NNS make/VBP decisions/NNS in/IN very/JJ different/JJ ways/NNS and/CC are/VBP each/DT susceptible/JJ to/TO very/RB different/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN errors/NNS ./. 
After-the-fact/JJ judicial/JJ examination/NN of/IN an/DT actor/NN 's/POS conduct/NN has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN the/DT common/JJ law/NN 's/POS method/NN ./. 
When/WRB only/RB civil/JJ liability/NN is/VBZ involved/VBN ,/, this/DT method/NN has/VBZ the/DT undeniable/JJ strengths/NNS of/IN factual/JJ specificity/NN and/CC avoidance/NN of/IN overgeneralization/NN ./. 
Still/RB ,/, case-by-case/JJ retrospective/NN decision/NN making/NN of/IN this/DT sort/NN is/VBZ vulnerable/JJ to/TO the/DT tunnel/NN vision/NN caused/VBN by/IN a/DT fixation/NN on/IN ad/FW hoc/FW (/( and/CC usually/RB sleazy/JJ )/) examples/NNS ./. 
When/WRB a/DT court/NN decides/VBZ that/IN a/DT particular/JJ actor/NN 's/POS conduct/NN was/VBD culpable/JJ and/CC so/RB extends/VBZ the/DT definition/NN of/IN insider/NN trading/NN to/TO reach/VB this/DT conduct/NN ,/, it/PP does/VBZ not/RB see/VB the/DT potentially/RB enormous/JJ number/NN of/IN other/JJ cases/NNS that/WDT will/MD be/VB covered/VBN by/IN the/DT expanded/VBN rule/NN ./. 
Thus/RB ,/, a/DT court/NN is/VBZ poorly/RB positioned/VBN to/TO make/VB judgments/NNS about/IN the/DT social/JJ utility/NN of/IN the/DT expanded/VBN rule/NN ./. 
For/IN example/NN ,/, in/IN focusing/VBG on/IN Mr./NP Freeman/NP 's/POS attempt/NN to/TO gain/VB nonpublic/JJ information/NN about/IN a/DT deal/NN 's/POS collapse/NN ,/, one/NN does/VBZ not/RB naturally/RB think/VB about/IN the/DT reverse/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT coin/NN :/: What/WP if/IN the/DT rumor/NN had/VBD been/VBN false/JJ ?/. 
Can/MD a/DT security/NN analyst/NN call/VB an/DT investment/NN banker/NN to/TO make/VB certain/JJ that/IN a/DT seemingly/RB improbable/JJ rumor/NN is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN false/JJ ?/. 
In/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, not/RB only/RB would/MD reputable/JJ professionals/NNS have/VBP rushed/VBN to/TO check/VB out/IN such/JJ rumors/NNS with/IN the/DT company/NN ,/, but/CC companies/NNS listed/VBN on/IN the/DT major/JJ stock/NN exchanges/NNS were/VBD encouraged/VBN by/IN the/DT exchanges/NNS to/TO respond/VB openly/RB to/TO such/JJ inquiries/NNS from/IN securities/NNS analysts/NNS ./. 
Today/NN ,/, after/IN Mr./NP Freeman/NP 's/POS plea/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ an/DT uncertainty/NN that/WDT is/VBZ both/DT unfair/JJ and/CC inefficient/JJ ./. 
In/IN this/DT light/NN ,/, the/DT comparative/JJ advantages/NNS of/IN legislative/JJ law-making/NNS become/VBP clear/JJ :/: (/( 1/LS )/) Before/IN it/PP acts/VBZ ,/, the/DT legislature/NN typically/RB will/MD hear/VB the/DT views/NNS of/IN representatives/NNS of/IN all/PDT those/DT affected/VBN by/IN its/PP$ decision/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB the/DT immediate/JJ parties/NNS before/IN the/DT court/NN ;/: and/CC (/( 2/LS )/) the/DT legislature/NN can/MD frame/VB ``/`` bright/JJ line/NN ''/'' standards/NNS that/WDT create/VBP less/JJR uncertainty/NN than/IN the/DT fact-bound/JJ decisions/NNS of/IN courts/NNS ./. 
Although/IN legislative/JJ lines/NNS can/MD result/VB in/IN under-inclusion/NN (/( which/WDT explains/VBZ why/WRB the/DT SEC/NP has/VBZ long/RB resisted/VBN a/DT legislative/JJ definition/NN of/IN insider/NN trading/NN )/) ,/, judicial/JJ lawmaking/NN inevitably/RB creates/VBZ uncertainty/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT shadowy/JJ outer/JJ edges/NNS and/CC implications/NNS of/IN most/JJS judicial/JJ decisions/NNS ./. 
At/IN least/JJS when/WRB the/DT stakes/NNS are/VBP high/JJ ,/, uncertainty/NN in/IN turn/NN results/VBZ in/IN overinclusion/NN ,/, as/IN individuals/NNS do/VBP not/RB dare/VB to/TO approach/VB an/DT uncertain/JJ line/NN closely/RB ./. 
The/DT federal/JJ mail/NN and/CC wire/NN fraud/NN statutes/NNS provide/VBP even/RB better/JJR illustrations/NNS of/IN the/DT rapid/JJ evolution/NN of/IN a/DT federal/JJ common/JJ law/NN of/IN white-collar/JJ crime/NN ./. 
In/IN 1987/CD ,/, the/DT Supreme/NP Court/NP attempted/VBD in/IN McNally/RB v./CC U.S./NP to/TO halt/VB the/DT inexorable/JJ expansion/NN of/IN these/DT statutes/NNS by/IN adopting/VBG a/DT rule/NN of/IN strict/JJ construction/NN for/IN ambiguous/JJ criminal/JJ statues/NNS ./. 
Yet/RB ,/, late/JJ last/JJ year/NN ,/, Congress/NP effectively/RB reversed/VBD this/DT decision/NN by/IN enacting/VBG a/DT one-sentence/JJ statute/NN that/WDT defined/VBD fraud/NN to/TO include/VB any/DT scheme/NN to/TO deprive/VB another/DT of/IN ``/`` the/DT intangible/JJ right/NN of/IN honest/JJ services/NNS ./. 
''/'' At/IN a/DT stroke/NN ,/, this/DT may/MD criminalize/VB all/DT fiduciary/JJ breaches/NNS (/( and/CC possibly/RB all/DT misrepresentations/NNS by/IN an/DT agent/NN or/CC employee/NN )/) ./. 
Such/PDT a/DT statute/NN illustrates/VBZ the/DT fundamental/JJ problem/NN :/: Congress/NP finds/VBZ it/PP is/VBZ easier/JJR to/TO pass/VB sweepingly/RB moralistic/JJ prohibitions/NNS ,/, which/WDT the/DT courts/NNS must/MD thereafter/RB interpret/VB ,/, than/IN to/TO engage/VB in/IN the/DT difficult/JJ line-drawing/JJ distinctions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP inherently/RB its/PP$ responsibility/NN ./. 
We/PP are/VBP confronted/VBN less/RBR with/IN a/DT judicial/JJ power/NN grab/NN than/IN with/IN a/DT legislative/JJ giveaway/NN ./. 
Predictably/RB ,/, when/WRB confronted/VBN with/IN morally/RB dubious/JJ behavior/NN ,/, prosecutors/NNS will/MD exploit/VB the/DT latitude/NN such/JJ openended/VBN statutes/NNS give/VBP them/PP ./.

At/IN least/JJS three/CD other/JJ factors/NNS have/VBP encouraged/VBN the/DT IMF/NP to/TO insist/VB on/IN increased/VBN capital/NN ./.

Japan/NP has/VBZ supported/VBN a/DT larger/JJR role/NN for/IN the/DT IMF/NP in/IN developing-country/JJ debt/NN issues/NNS ,/, and/CC is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ financial/JJ resource/NN for/IN IMF-guided/JJ programs/NNS in/IN developing/VBG countries/NNS ./.

Opponents/NNS show/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP already/RB more/JJR funds/NNS available/JJ than/IN commendable/JJ reform/NN efforts/NNS ./.

A/DT U.S./NP decision/NN to/TO refuse/VB the/DT IMF/NP its/PP$ capital/NN increase/NN ,/, or/CC limit/VB it/PP to/TO 25/CD %/NN ,/, would/MD bring/VB a/DT major/JJ change/NN in/IN international/JJ economic/JJ policy/NN ,/, and/CC could/MD not/RB be/VB taken/VBN lightly/RB ./.

But/CC now/RB ,/, the/DT magazine/NN is/VBZ attempting/VBG to/TO fight/VB back/RB ,/, with/IN an/DT ambitious/JJ plan/NN including/VBG a/DT revamped/VBN sales/NNS strategy/NN and/CC a/DT surprisingly/RB aggressive/JJ ad/NN campaign/NN ./. 
Advertisers/NNS do/VBP n't/RB think/VB of/IN the/DT magazine/NN first/RB ,/, says/VBZ Joan/NP McCraw/NP ,/, who/WP joined/VBD in/IN April/NP as/IN national/JJ advertising/NN director/NN ./. 
``/`` What/WP we/PP want/VBP to/TO do/VB is/VBZ take/VB a/DT more/RBR aggressive/JJ stance/NN ./. 
People/NNS did/VBD n't/RB believe/VB we/PP were/VBD in/IN tune/NN with/IN the/DT marketplace/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN many/JJ ways/NNS we/PP were/VBD n't/RB ./. 
''/'' The/DT 101-year-old/JJ magazine/NN has/VBZ never/RB had/VBN to/TO woo/VB advertisers/NNS with/IN quite/RB so/RB much/JJ fervor/NN before/RB ./. 
It/PP largely/RB rested/VBD on/IN its/PP$ hard-to-fault/JJ demographics/NNS :/: 10.8/CD million/CD subscribers/NNS in/IN the/DT first/JJ half/NN ,/, up/RB from/IN 10.5/CD million/CD a/DT year/NN ago/RB ;/: an/DT average/JJ age/NN of/IN 42/CD for/IN readers/NNS --/: at/IN the/DT height/NN of/IN their/PP$ consuming/NN years/NNS ;/: loyalty/NN to/TO the/DT tune/NN of/IN an/DT 85/CD %/NN average/JJ subscription/NN renewal/NN rate/NN ./. 
The/DT magazine/NN had/VBD its/PP$ best/JJS year/NN yet/RB in/IN 1988/CD ,/, when/WRB it/PP celebrated/VBD its/PP$ centennial/NN and/CC racked/VBD up/RP a/DT 17/CD %/NN gain/NN in/IN ad/NN pages/NNS ,/, to/TO 283/CD ./. 
But/CC this/DT year/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT hullabaloo/NN surrounding/VBG its/PP$ centennial/NN died/VBD ,/, so/RB too/RB did/VBD some/DT advertiser/NN interest/NN ./. 
The/DT reason/NN ,/, ad/NN executives/NNS say/VBP ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT entire/JJ magazine/NN business/NN has/VBZ been/VBN soft/JJ --/: and/CC National/NP Geographic/NP has/VBZ some/DT quirks/NNS that/WDT make/VBP it/PP especially/RB unattractive/JJ during/IN a/DT soft/JJ market/NN ./. 
Perhaps/RB the/DT biggest/JJS of/IN those/DT factors/NNS is/VBZ its/PP$ high/JJ ad/NN prices/NNS --/: $/$ 130,000/CD for/IN a/DT four-color/JJ page/NN ,/, vs./FW $/$ 47,000/CD for/IN the/DT Smithsonian/NP ,/, a/DT comparable/JJ publication/NN with/IN a/DT far/RB smaller/JJR circulation/NN ./. 
When/WRB ad/NN dollars/NNS are/VBP tight/JJ ,/, the/DT high/JJ page/NN cost/NN is/VBZ a/DT major/JJ deterrent/NN for/IN advertisers/NNS ,/, who/WP generally/RB want/VBP to/TO appear/VB regularly/RB in/IN a/DT publication/NN or/CC not/RB at/IN all/DT ./. 
Even/RB though/IN National/NP Geographic/NP offers/VBZ far/RB more/JJR readers/NNS than/IN does/VBZ a/DT magazine/NN like/IN Smithsonian/NP ,/, ``/`` the/DT page/NN costs/VBZ you/PP an/DT arm/NN and/CC a/DT leg/NN to/TO develop/VB any/DT frequency,``/`` says/NNS Harry/NP Glass/NP ,/, New/NP York/NP media/NNS manager/NN for/IN Bozell/NP Inc/NP ./. 
To/TO combat/VB that/DT problem/NN ,/, National/NP Geographic/NP ,/, like/IN other/JJ magazines/NNS ,/, began/VBD offering/VBG regional/JJ editions/NNS allowing/VBG advertisers/NNS to/TO appear/VB in/IN only/RB a/DT portion/NN of/IN its/PP$ magazines/NNS --/: for/IN example/NN ,/, ads/NNS can/MD run/VB only/RB in/IN the/DT magazines/NNS sent/VBN to/TO subscribers/NNS in/IN the/DT largest/JJS 25/CD markets/NNS ./. 
But/CC the/DT magazine/NN was/VBD slower/JJR than/IN its/PP$ competitors/NNS to/TO come/VB up/RB with/IN its/PP$ regional/JJ editions/NNS ,/, and/CC until/IN last/JJ year/NN offered/VBD fewer/JJR of/IN them/PP than/IN did/VBD competitors/NNS ./.

Another/DT sticking/JJ point/NN for/IN advertisers/NNS was/VBD National/NP Geographic/NP 's/POS tradition/NN of/IN lumping/VBG its/PP$ ads/NNS together/RB ,/, usually/RB at/IN the/DT beginning/NN or/CC end/NN of/IN the/DT magazine/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN spreading/VBG ads/NNS out/RP among/IN its/PP$ articles/NNS ,/, as/IN most/JJS magazines/NNS do/VBP ./. 
And/CC National/NP Geographic/NP 's/POS smaller-than-average/JJ size/NN means/VBZ extra/JJ production/NN costs/NNS for/IN advertisers/NNS ./. 
But/CC Ms./NP McCraw/NP says/VBZ the/DT magazine/NN is/VBZ fighting/VBG back/RB ./. 
It/PP now/RB offers/VBZ 30/CD regional/JJ editions/NNS ,/, it/PP very/RB recently/RB began/VBD running/VBG ads/NNS adjacent/JJ to/TO articles/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PP has/VBZ been/VBN beefing/VBG up/RP its/PP$ sales/NNS force/NN ./.

Traders/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO oppose/VB such/JJ restrictions/NNS because/IN dual/JJ trading/NN provides/VBZ a/DT way/NN to/TO make/VB money/NN in/IN slower/JJR markets/NNS where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT shortage/NN of/IN customer/NN orders/NNS ./.

The/DT Army/NP headquarters/NN on/IN the/DT third/JJ deck/NN of/IN the/DT Pentagon/NP used/VBD to/TO burn/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN incense/NN to/TO him/PP ,/, but/CC the/DT Navy/NP headquarters/NN on/IN the/DT fourth/JJ deck/NN made/VBD them/PP stop/VB it/PP ./.

Which/WDT brings/VBZ up/RB the/DT worst/JJS and/CC meanest/JJS ghost/NN of/IN all/DT --/: the/DT ghost/NN of/IN the/DT shah/NN of/IN Iran/NP ./. 
When/WRB the/DT shah/NN died/VBD ,/, President/NP Carter/NP was/VBD so/RB scared/VBN that/IN the/DT shah/NN 's/POS ghost/NN would/MD blame/VB him/PP for/IN shoving/VBG him/PP out/RP to/TO make/VB way/NN for/IN the/DT ayatollah/NN that/IN he/PP declared/VBD the/DT Carter/NP Doctrine/NP ./. 
Mr./NP Carter/NP said/VBD he/PP would/MD go/VB to/TO war/NN to/TO stop/VB anyone/NN from/IN trying/VBG to/TO grab/VB Iran/NP ./. 
But/CC that/DT ghost/NN would/MD n't/RB settle/VB for/IN words/NNS ,/, he/PP wanted/VBD money/NN and/CC people/NNS --/: lots/NNS ./. 
So/RB Mr./NP Carter/NP formed/VBD three/CD new/JJ Army/NP divisions/NNS and/CC gave/VBD them/PP to/TO a/DT new/JJ bureaucracy/NN in/IN Tampa/NP called/VBN the/DT Rapid/NP Deployment/NP Force/NP ./.

After/IN Mr./NP Carter/NP was/VBD defeated/VBN in/IN 1980/CD ,/, the/DT shah/NN 's/POS ghost/NN claimed/VBD the/DT credit/NN and/CC then/RB went/VBD after/IN President/NP Reagan/NP and/CC Cap/NP Weinberger/NP ./. 
I/PP saw/VBD what/WP he/PP did/VBD to/TO them/PP firsthand/RB ./. 
It/PP made/VBD my/PP$ shoelaces/NNS dance/VB with/IN terror/NN ./. 
Why/WRB ,/, he/PP used/VBD to/TO lay/VB in/IN wait/NN for/IN Cap/NP ;/: suddenly/RB he/PP 'd/MD leap/VB from/IN behind/IN some/DT statue/NN of/IN Marshall/NP onto/IN Cap/NP 's/POS chest/NN and/CC grab/VB him/PP by/IN the/DT throat/NN and/CC choke/VB him/PP till/IN he/PP coughed/VBD up/RP an/DT additional/JJ $/$ 2/CD billion/CD or/CC so/RB ./. 
Cap/NP added/VBD four/CD more/JJR divisions/NNS to/TO the/DT Army/NP ,/, two/CD active/JJ and/CC two/CD reserve/JJ ;/: two/CD carrier/NN groups/NNS to/TO the/DT Navy/NP ;/: a/DT division/NN --/: equivalent/JJ to/TO the/DT Marines/NPS ;/: and/CC the/DT C-5B/NN ,/, KC-10/NN ,/, C-17/NN and/CC a/DT thousand/CD tactical/JJ aircraft/NN to/TO the/DT Air/NP Force/NP ./. 
He/PP bought/VBD $/$ 4/CD billion/CD in/IN prepositioning/JJ ships/NNS and/CC $/$ 7/CD billion/CD in/IN ammo/NN and/CC equipment/NN to/TO fill/VB them/PP ,/, and/CC parked/VBD them/PP at/IN a/DT new/JJ $/$ 6/CD billion/CD base/NN at/IN Diego/NP Garcia/NP in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN the/DT Indian/NP Ocean/NP ./. 
He/PP dedicated/VBD all/PDT these/DT new/JJ forces/NNS to/TO the/DT Persian/NP Gulf/NP ./. 
One/CD night/NN both/DT Marshall/NP 's/POS ghost/NN and/CC the/DT shah/NN 's/POS ghost/NN together/RB caught/VBN Cap/NP and/CC threw/VBD him/PP to/TO the/DT ground/NN ./.

He/PP gave/VBD those/DT bureaucrats/NNS charge/NN of/IN all/DT naval/JJ operations/NNS in/IN the/DT Persian/NP Gulf/NP and/CC Indian/NP Ocean/NP ./. 
Marshall/NP figured/VBD it/PP would/MD be/VB good/JJ training/NN for/IN those/DT soldiers/NNS --/: someday/RB maybe/RB they/PP would/MD get/VB the/DT whole/JJ Navy/NP ./. 
They/PP had/VBD fun/NN moving/VBG the/DT carriers/NNS around/RP ,/, but/CC it/PP turned/VBD out/RB that/IN they/PP had/VBD forgotten/VBN all/DT about/IN mine/JJ sweepers/NNS ./. 
But/CC the/DT shah/NN still/RB kept/VBD leaping/VBG out/IN at/IN Cap/NP ,/, so/RB Cap/NP bought/VBD a/DT hundred/CD merchant/NN ships/NNS more/JJR and/CC $/$ 7/CD billion/CD of/IN loading/NN barges/NNS ,/, ramps/NNS ,/, etc./FW ,/, in/IN order/NN that/IN those/DT seven/CD new/JJ Army/NP divisions/NNS and/CC three/CD Marine/NP brigades/NNS could/MD unload/VB from/IN all/PDT those/DT new/JJ ships/NNS and/CC aircraft/NN and/CC go/VB to/TO war/NN in/IN the/DT Zagros/NP mountains/NNS ./. 
Then/RB suddenly/RB Ike/NP 's/POS ghost/NN came/VBD to/TO visit/VB and/CC said/VBD ,/, ``/`` What/WP the/DT hell/NN are/VBP you/PP doing/VBG planning/VBG for/IN a/DT land/NN war/NN in/IN Asia/NP 12,000/CD miles/NNS away/RB ?/.

''/'' Lucky/JJ for/IN Cap/NP ,/, Ike/NP was/VBD easygoing/JJ and/CC soon/RB went/VBD away/RB ,/, while/IN the/DT shah/NN --/: he/PP kept/VBD coming/VBG back/RB ./.

Many/JJ investors/NNS say/VBP the/DT circuit/NN breakers/NNS ,/, instituted/VBN following/VBG the/DT 1987/CD collapse/NN ,/, provided/VBN little/JJ reassurance/NN ./.

For/IN instance/NN ,/, the/DT group/NN projected/VBD that/DT revenue/NN would/MD increase/VB nearly/RB 10/CD %/NN annually/RB over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./.

``/`` Service/NN ''/'' should/MD be/VB service/NN ./. 
As/IN commonly/RB understood/VBN ,/, service/NN implies/VBZ sacrifice/NN ./. 
It/PP involves/VBZ accepting/VBG risk/NN ,/, or/CC giving/VBG up/IN income/NN ,/, or/CC deferring/VBG a/DT career/NN ./.

It/PP should/MD also/RB encourage/VB service/NN --/: preferably/RB by/IN all/DT classes/NNS and/CC all/DT ages/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT mid-June/NP round/NN of/IN voting/NN ,/, Greeks/NPS gave/VBD no/DT clear/JJ mandate/NN to/TO any/DT single/JJ political/JJ party/NN ./. 
The/DT ad/NN interim/NN coalition/NN government/NN that/WDT emerged/VBD from/IN post-electoral/JJ hagglings/NNS was/VBD ,/, in/IN essence/NN ,/, little/RB more/JJR than/IN the/DT ill-conceived/JJ offspring/NN of/IN ideological/JJ miscegenation/NN :/: On/IN one/CD side/NN ,/, the/DT center-right/JJ New/NP Democracy/NP Party/NP ,/, headed/VBN by/IN Constantine/NP Mitsotakis/NP ./. 
On/IN the/DT other/JJ ,/, the/DT so-called/JJ Coalition/NP of/IN the/DT Left/NP and/CC Progress/NP --/: a/DT quaint/JJ and/CC rather/RB deceptive/JJ title/NN for/IN a/DT merger/NN of/IN the/DT pro-Soviet/JJ Communist/NP Party/NP of/IN Greece/NP and/CC its/PP$ Euro-Communist/NP cousin/NN ,/, the/DT Hellenic/NP Left/NP ./. 
The/DT unifying/VBG bond/NN for/IN this/DT left-right/JJ mismatch/NN was/VBD plain/JJ :/: PASOK/NP (/( Mr./NP Papandreou/NP 's/POS party/NN )/) as/IN common/JJ political/JJ enemy/NN ./. 
The/DT ostensible/JJ goal/NN was/VBD a/DT mop-up/NN of/IN government/NN corruption/NN ,/, purportedly/RB at/IN all/DT levels/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT main/JJ marks/NNS were/VBD Mr./NP Papandreou/NP and/CC his/PP$ closest/JJS associates/NNS ./. 
In/IN point/NN of/IN fact/NN ,/, this/DT catharsis/NN was/VBD overdue/JJ by/IN decades/NNS ./. 
When/WRB reduced/VBN to/TO buzzword/NN status/NN in/IN ex/JJ parte/NN pledges/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, the/DT notion/NN transmogrified/VBD into/IN a/DT promised/VBN assault/NN ,/, with/IN targets/NNS primarily/RB for/IN political/JJ gains/NNS ,/, not/RB justice/NN ./. 
With/IN regard/NN to/TO Greece/NP 's/POS long-bubbling/JJ bank-looting/JJ scandal/NN ,/, Mr./NP Papandreou/NP 's/POS principal/JJ accuser/NN remains/VBZ George/NP Koskotas/NP ,/, former/JJ owner/NN of/IN the/DT Bank/NP of/IN Crete/NP and/CC self-confessed/JJ embezzler/NN ,/, now/RB residing/VBG in/IN a/DT jail/NN cell/NN in/IN Salem/NP ,/, Mass./NP ,/, from/IN where/WRB he/PP is/VBZ fighting/VBG extradition/NN proceedings/NNS that/WDT would/MD return/VB him/PP to/TO Greece/NP ./. 
Mr./NP Koskotas/NP 's/POS credibility/NN is/VBZ ,/, at/IN best/JJS ,/, problematic/JJ ./. 
He/PP has/VBZ ample/JJ motive/NN to/TO shift/VB the/DT blame/NN ,/, and/CC his/PP$ testimony/NN has/VBZ also/RB been/VBN found/VBN less/RBR than/IN forthright/JJ on/IN numerous/JJ points/NNS ./. 
Nevertheless/RB ,/, the/DT New/NP Democracy/NP and/CC Communist/NP parties/NNS herald/VBP his/PP$ assertions/NNS as/IN proof/NN of/IN PASOK/NP complicity/NN ./. 
Among/IN unanswered/JJ questions/NNS are/VBP whether/IN Mr./NP Papandreou/NP received/VBD $/$ 23/CD million/CD of/IN stolen/VBN Bank/NP of/IN Crete/NP funds/NNS and/CC an/DT additional/JJ $/$ 734,000/CD in/IN bribes/NNS ,/, as/RB contended/VBN ;/: whether/IN the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN ordered/VBD state/NN agencies/NNS to/TO deposit/VB some/DT $/$ 57/CD million/CD in/IN Mr./NP Koskotas/NP 's/POS bank/NN and/CC then/RB skim/VB off/IN the/DT interest/NN ;/: and/CC ,/, what/WP PASOK/NP 's/POS cut/NN was/VBD from/IN the/DT $/$ 210/CD million/CD Mr./NP Koskotas/NP pinched/VBD ./. 
Two/CD former/JJ ministers/NNS were/VBD so/RB heavily/RB implicated/VBN in/IN the/DT Koskotas/NP affair/NN that/IN PASOK/NP members/NNS of/IN Parliament/NP voted/VBD to/TO refer/VB them/PP to/TO the/DT special/JJ court/NN ./. 
But/CC eluding/VBG parliamentary/JJ probe/NN was/VBD the/DT case/NN of/IN millions/NNS of/IN drachmas/NN Mr./NP Koskotas/NP funneled/VBD into/IN New/NP Democracy/NP coffers/NNS ./. 
In/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, the/DT investigation/NN produced/VBD only/RB circumstantial/JJ evidence/NN and/CC ``/`` indications/NNS ''/'' that/IN point/NN to/TO PASOK/NP ,/, not/RB clinching/VBG proof/NN ./. 
On/IN another/DT issue/NN ,/, Greeks/NPS were/VBD told/VBN how/WRB their/PP$ national/JJ intelligence/NN agency/NN ,/, the/DT EYP/NP ,/, regularly/RB monitored/VBD the/DT telephone/NN conversations/NNS of/IN prominent/JJ figures/NNS ,/, including/VBG key/JJ opposition/NN politicians/NNS ,/, journalists/NNS and/CC PASOK/NP cabinet/NN members/NNS ./. 
Despite/IN convincing/JJ arguments/NNS ,/, it/PP was/VBD never/RB established/VBN that/IN Mr./NP Papandreou/NP personally/RB ordered/VBD or/CC directed/VBD the/DT wiretaps/NNS ./. 
The/DT central/JJ weakness/NN of/IN the/DT ``/`` scandals/NNS ''/'' debates/NNS was/VBD pointed/VBN up/IN especially/RB well/RB when/WRB discussions/NNS focused/VBD on/IN arms/NNS deals/NNS and/CC kickbacks/NNS ./. 
The/DT coalition/NN government/NN tried/VBD to/TO show/VB that/IN PASOK/NP ministers/NNS had/VBD received/VBN hefty/JJ sums/NNS for/IN OKing/NP the/DT purchase/NN of/IN F-16/NP Fighting/NP Falcon/NP and/CC Mirage/NP 2000/CD combat/NN aircraft/NN ,/, produced/VBN by/IN the/DT U.S.based/JJ General/NP Dynamics/NP Corp./NP and/CC France/NP 's/POS Avions/NP Marcel/NP Dassault/NP ,/, respectively/RB ./. 
Naturally/RB ,/, neither/CC General/NP Dynamics/NP nor/CC Dassault/NP could/MD be/VB expected/VBN to/TO hamper/VB its/PP$ prospective/JJ future/NN dealings/NNS by/IN making/VBG disclosures/NNS of/IN sums/NNS paid/VBN (/( or/CC not/RB )/) to/TO various/JJ Greek/JJ officials/NNS for/IN services/NNS rendered/VBN ./. 
So/IN it/PP seems/VBZ that/IN Mr./NP Mitsotakis/NP and/CC his/PP$ communist/NN chums/NNS may/MD have/VB unwittingly/RB served/VBN Mr./NP Papandreou/NP a/DT moral/JJ victory/NN on/IN a/DT platter/JJ :/: PASOK/NP ,/, whether/IN guilty/JJ or/CC not/RB ,/, can/MD now/RB traipse/VB the/DT countryside/NN condemning/VBG the/DT whole/JJ affair/NN as/IN a/DT witch/NN hunt/NN at/IN Mr./NP Papandreou/NP 's/POS expense/NN ./. 
But/CC while/IN verbal/JJ high/JJ jinks/NNS alone/RB wo/MD n't/RB help/VB PASOK/NP regain/VB power/NN ,/, Mr./NP Papandreou/NP should/MD never/RB be/VB underestimated/VBN ./. 
First/RB came/VBD his/PP$ predictable/JJ fusillade/NN :/: He/PP charged/VBD the/DT Coalition/NP of/IN the/DT Left/NP and/CC Progress/NP had/VBD sold/VBN out/IN its/PP$ leftist/JJ tenets/NNS by/IN collaborating/VBG in/IN a/DT right-wing/JJ plot/NN aimed/VBN at/IN ousting/VBG PASOK/NP and/CC thwarting/VBG the/DT course/NN of/IN socialism/NN in/IN Greece/NP ./. 
Then/RB ,/, to/TO buttress/VB his/PP$ credibility/NN with/IN the/DT left/JJ ,/, he/PP enticed/VBD some/DT smaller/JJR leftist/JJ parties/NNS to/TO stand/VB for/IN election/NN under/IN the/DT PASOK/NP banner/NN ./. 
Next/JJ ,/, he/PP continued/VBD to/TO court/VB the/DT communists/NNS --/: many/JJ of/IN whom/WP feel/VBP betrayed/VBN by/IN the/DT left-right/JJ coalition/NN 's/POS birth/NN --/: by/IN bringing/VBG into/IN PASOK/NP a/DT well-respected/JJ Communist/NP Party/NP candidate/NN ./. 
For/IN balance/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN hopes/NNS of/IN gaining/VBG some/DT disaffected/JJ centrist/JJ votes/NNS ,/, he/PP managed/VBD to/TO attract/VB a/DT former/JJ New/NP Democracy/NP Party/NP representative/NN and/CC known/VBN political/JJ enemy/NN of/IN Mr./NP Mitsotakis/NP ./. 
Thus/RB PASOK/NP heads/VBZ for/IN the/DT polls/NNS not/RB only/RB with/IN diminished/VBN scandal-stench/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB with/IN ``/`` seals/NNS of/IN approval/NN ''/'' from/IN representatives/NNS of/IN its/PP$ harshest/JJS accusers/NNS ./. 
Crucial/JJ as/IN these/DT elections/NNS are/VBP for/IN Greece/NP ,/, pressing/VBG issues/NNS of/IN state/NN are/VBP getting/VBG lost/VBN in/IN the/DT shuffle/NN ./. 
The/DT country/NN 's/POS future/JJ NATO/NP participation/NN remains/VBZ unsure/JJ ,/, for/IN instance/NN ./. 
Greece/NP also/RB must/MD revamp/VB major/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN legislation/NN in/IN preparation/NN for/IN the/DT 1992/CD targets/NNS of/IN heightened/VBN Common/NP Market/NP cooperation/NN ./. 
Greece/NP 's/POS bilateral/JJ relations/NNS with/IN the/DT U.S./NP need/VBP attention/NN soon/RB as/IN well/RB ./. 
For/IN one/CD ,/, the/DT current/JJ accord/NN concerning/VBG U.S./NP military/JJ bases/NNS in/IN Greece/NP lapses/VBZ in/IN May/NP 1990/CD ./.

Another/DT matter/NN of/IN concern/NN is/VBZ the/DT extradition/NN of/IN Mohammed/NP Rashid/NP ,/, a/DT Palestinian/JJ terrorist/NN who/WP is/VBZ wanted/VBN in/IN the/DT U.S./NP for/IN the/DT 1982/CD bombing/NN of/IN a/DT Pan/NP American/NP Airways/NPS flight/NN ./. 
The/DT Greek/NP courts/NNS have/VBP decided/VBN in/IN favor/NN of/IN extradition/NN in/IN the/DT Rashid/NP case/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT matter/NN awaits/VBZ final/JJ approval/NN from/IN Greece/NP 's/POS next/JJ justice/NN minister/NN ./. 
The/DT Greeks/NPS seem/VBP barely/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT importance/NN of/IN the/DT case/NN as/IN a/DT litmus/NN test/NN of/IN whether/IN Greece/NP will/MD be/VB counted/VBN in/IN or/CC out/IN for/IN international/JJ efforts/NNS to/TO combat/VB terrorism/NN ./. 
That/IN PASOK/NP could/MD win/VB the/DT elections/NNS outright/RB is/VBZ improbable/JJ ;/: the/DT Greek/JJ press/NN ,/, previously/RB eager/JJ to/TO palm/VB off/IN PASOK/NP 's/POS line/NN ,/, has/VBZ turned/VBN on/IN Mr./NP Papandreou/NP with/IN a/DT wild-eyed/JJ vengeance/NN ./. 
Yet/RB the/DT possibility/NN of/IN another/DT lash-up/JJ government/NN is/VBZ all/RB too/RB real/JJ ./. 
If/IN Mr./NP Papandreou/NP becomes/VBZ the/DT major/JJ opposition/NN leader/NN ,/, he/PP could/MD hamstring/VB a/DT conservative-led/JJ coalition/NN ./. 
Also/RB ,/, he/PP could/MD force/VB new/JJ elections/NNS early/JJ next/JJ year/NN by/IN frustrating/VBG the/DT procedures/NNS for/IN the/DT election/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN of/IN the/DT republic/NN in/IN March/NP ./. 
New/NP Democracy/NP has/VBZ once/RB again/RB glaringly/RB underestimated/VBN the/DT opponent/NN and/CC linked/VBN its/PP$ own/JJ prospects/NNS to/TO negative/JJ reaction/NN against/IN PASOK/NP ,/, forgetting/VBG to/TO tend/VB to/TO either/CC program/NN clarity/NN or/CC the/DT rectification/NN of/IN internal/JJ squabbles/NNS ./. 
As/IN for/IN Mr./NP Papandreou/NP ?/. 
He/PP 's/VBZ not/RB exactly/RB sitting/VBG pretty/RB at/IN this/DT stage/NN ./.
