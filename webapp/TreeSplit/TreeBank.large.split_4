In/IN 1925/CD ,/, following/VBG the/DT horrific/JJ experience/NN of/IN chemical/JJ warfare/NN in/IN World/NP War/NP I/NP ,/, an/DT international/JJ convention/NN banning/VBG the/DT first/JJ use/NN of/IN chemical/JJ weapons/NNS was/VBD signed/VBN ./. 
Even/RB this/DT modest/JJ agreement/NN has/VBZ proved/VBN extremely/RB difficult/JJ to/TO verify/VB and/CC enforce/VB ./. 
As/RB blatant/JJ a/DT case/NN as/IN Iraq/NP 's/POS repeated/JJ use/NN of/IN CW/NP during/IN its/PP$ war/NN with/IN Iran/NP and/CC on/IN the/DT Kurds/NPS failed/VBD to/TO precipitate/VB global/JJ condemnation/NN ,/, to/TO say/VB nothing/NN of/IN sanctions/NNS ./.

The/DT draft/JJ CW/NP accord/NN now/RB being/VBG developed/VBN in/IN Geneva/NP would/MD require/VB only/RB that/IN 60/CD countries/NNS have/VBP to/TO enroll/VB before/IN the/DT treaty/NN enters/VBZ into/IN force/NN ./.

''/'' The/DT prospects/NNS that/IN a/DT comprehensive/JJ CW/NP ban/NN could/MD be/VB verifiable/JJ are/VBP no/RB better/JJR ./.

Why/WRB ,/, then/RB ,/, is/VBZ the/DT Bush/NP administration/NN pursuing/VBG a/DT ban/NN so/RB aggressively/RB ?/. 
Regrettably/RB ,/, the/DT answer/NN seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB that/IN Mr./NP Bush/NP has/VBZ become/VBN --/: even/RB ,/, according/VBG to/TO published/VBN reports/NNS ,/, in/IN the/DT eyes/NNS of/IN his/PP$ own/JJ staff/NN --/: ``/`` fixated/VBN ''/'' on/IN a/DT CW/NP ban/NN ./. 
The/DT president/NN 's/POS obsession/NN evidently/RB dates/VBZ from/IN 1982/CD when/WRB ,/, as/IN vice/NN president/NN ,/, he/PP was/VBD obliged/VBN to/TO cast/VB the/DT first/JJ of/IN three/CD tie-breaking/JJ votes/NNS in/IN the/DT Senate/NP needed/VBN to/TO resume/VB U.S./NP chemical-weapons/NNS production/NN ,/, suspended/VBN in/IN 1969/CD ./.

By/IN way/NN of/IN penance/NN ,/, Mr./NP Bush/NP apparently/RB resolved/VBD to/TO become/VB the/DT champion/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ chemical-arms-control/JJ regime/NN aimed/VBN at/IN banning/VBG all/DT such/JJ production/NN and/CC stockpiling/NN ./. 
In/IN 1984/CD ,/, he/PP personally/RB introduced/VBD at/IN the/DT Conference/NP on/IN Disarmament/NP in/IN Geneva/NP a/DT U.S./NP draft/JJ treaty/NN prepared/VBN in/IN great/JJ haste/NN for/IN the/DT occasion/NN ./. 
Worse/JJR yet/RB ,/, Mr./NP Bush/NP 's/POS interest/NN in/IN a/DT CW/NP ban/NN prevented/VBD the/DT Reagan/NP administration/NN in/IN 1987/CD from/IN adopting/VBG a/DT more/RBR honest/JJ and/CC responsible/JJ position/NN toward/IN such/JJ an/DT accord/NN :/: As/IN the/DT U.S./NP binary/JJ modernization/NN program/NN got/VBD under/IN way/NN ,/, the/DT Soviet/NP Union/NP became/VBD ever/RB more/RBR determined/JJ to/TO conclude/VB a/DT CW/NP ban/NN quickly/RB ./. 
Suddenly/RB ,/, U.S./NP demands/NNS for/IN intrusive/JJ inspection/NN arrangements/NNS that/WDT previously/RB had/VBD deadlocked/VBN the/DT chemical-arms-control/JJ talks/NNS were/VBD acceptable/JJ to/TO Moscow/NP ./. 
Unless/IN it/PP modified/VBD its/PP$ position/NN ,/, the/DT Reagan/NP administration/NN faced/VBD the/DT prospect/NN of/IN reaching/VBG agreement/NN on/IN a/DT treaty/NN to/TO which/WDT it/PP and/CC its/PP$ predecessors/NNS had/VBD paid/VBN lip/JJ service/NN but/CC that/IN it/PP knew/VBD to/TO be/VB dangerously/RB unverifiable/JJ ./. 
Every/DT relevant/JJ agency/NN in/IN the/DT U.S./NP government/NN concluded/VBD that/IN the/DT U.S./NP needed/VBD to/TO alter/VB its/PP$ position/NN ./. 
But/CC for/IN the/DT intervention/NN of/IN a/DT representative/NN of/IN then-Vice/NP President/NP Bush/NP ,/, the/DT U.S./NP would/MD have/VB given/VBN up/RP the/DT quest/NN for/IN a/DT near-term/JJ CW/NP ban/NN in/IN favor/NN of/IN other/JJ ,/, less/RBR ambitious/JJ objectives/NNS ./. 
What/WP remains/VBZ to/TO be/VB seen/VBN is/VBZ whether/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS personal/JJ attachment/NN to/TO this/DT cause/NN will/MD force/VB the/DT potentially/RB crucial/JJ stipulations/NNS he/PP enunciated/VBD in/IN his/PP$ U.N./NP speech/NN to/TO be/VB set/VBN aside/RB ./. 
It/PP must/MD be/VB expected/VBN that/IN the/DT Soviets/NPS ,/, Western/JJ European/JJ nations/NNS and/CC some/DT in/IN Congress/NP will/MD try/VB to/TO get/VB Mr./NP Bush/NP to/TO abandon/VB his/PP$ implicit/JJ commitment/NN to/TO continue/VB binary/JJ production/NN and/CC maintain/VB an/DT effective/JJ retaliatory/JJ CW/NP stockpile/NN until/IN the/DT unlikely/JJ time/NN when/WRB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT legitimate/JJ basis/NN for/IN believing/VBG that/IN every/DT CW-capable/JJ nation/NN is/VBZ verifiably/RB eliminating/VBG that/DT capability/NN ./.

They/PP mark/VBP the/DT first/JJ ventures/NNS of/IN Sir/NP Peter/NP Hall/NP in/IN the/DT commercial/JJ arena/NN ./. 
For/IN 30/CD years/NNS Sir/NP Peter/NP has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT quintessential/JJ not-for-profit/JJ theater/NN man/NN ./. 
In/IN 1960/CD he/PP founded/VBD the/DT Royal/NP Shakespeare/NP Company/NP ,/, which/WDT he/PP headed/VBD until/IN 1968/CD ,/, and/CC in/IN 1973/CD took/VBD over/IN the/DT leadership/NN of/IN Britain/NP 's/POS National/NP Theatre/NP ,/, now/RB the/DT Royal/NP National/NP Theatre/NP ,/, from/IN Laurence/NP Olivier/NP ./. 
It/PP was/VBD Sir/NP Peter/NP who/WP brought/VBD the/DT National/NP to/TO renown/VB in/IN its/PP$ new/JJ home/NN on/IN the/DT South/NP Bank/NP of/IN the/DT Thames/NP ./. 
Last/JJ year/NN Sir/NP Peter/NP announced/VBD that/IN he/PP was/VBD leaving/VBG the/DT National/NP to/TO form/VB a/DT commercial/JJ venture/NN ,/, Peter/NP Hall/NP Co./NP ,/, to/TO produce/VB classical/JJ plays/NNS in/IN London/NP ,/, New/NP York/NP and/CC elsewhere/RB ./. 
His/PP$ first/JJ two/CD attempts/NNS have/VBP been/VBN ``/`` Orpheus/NP ''/'' and/CC ``/`` Merchant/NN ,/, ''/'' which/WDT ,/, in/IN London/NP at/IN least/JJS ,/, have/VBP been/VBN enormously/RB successful/JJ ./. 
Does/VBZ the/DT flurry/NN of/IN activity/NN on/IN Broadway/NP mean/VB that/IN the/DT long/JJ drought/NN is/VBZ over/RP ,/, that/IN the/DT problems/NNS that/WDT have/VBP plagued/VBN the/DT theater/NN for/IN the/DT last/JJ decade/NN have/VBP disappeared/VBN ?/. 
Unfortunately/RB ,/, not/RB in/IN the/DT least/JJS ./. 
Ironically/RB the/DT volume/NN of/IN productions/NNS this/DT fall/NN is/VBZ partly/RB the/DT result/NN of/IN problems/NNS that/WDT remain/VBP endemic/JJ ./. 
One/CD of/IN these/DT is/VBZ the/DT length/NN of/IN time/NN it/PP takes/VBZ to/TO move/VB a/DT production/NN from/IN the/DT planning/NN stage/NN to/TO an/DT opening/NN on/IN Broadway/NP ,/, especially/RB a/DT musical/NN ./. 
Many/JJ of/IN the/DT musicals/NNS arriving/VBG this/DT season/NN are/VBP revivals/NNS ,/, not/RB only/RB because/IN they/PP are/VBP proven/JJ commodities/NNS but/CC because/IN it/PP does/VBZ n't/RB take/VB the/DT same/JJ length/NN of/IN time/NN to/TO assemble/VB all/PDT the/DT elements/NNS ./. 
Part/NN of/IN the/DT explanation/NN for/IN the/DT fall/NN activity/NN is/VBZ that/IN several/JJ productions/NNS that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN in/IN the/DT planning/NN stage/NN for/IN several/JJ years/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN ``/`` Meet/VB Me/PP in/IN St./NP Louis/NP ,/, ''/'' are/VBP fortuitously/RB ripe/JJ for/IN Broadway/NP at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./. 
The/DT problems/NNS in/IN mounting/VBG a/DT musical/NN ,/, especially/RB the/DT financial/JJ problems/NNS ,/, remain/VBP very/RB much/RB with/IN us/PP ./. 
A/DT good/JJ example/NN is/VBZ ``/`` Jerome/NP Robbins/NP '/POS Broadway/NP ,/, ''/'' the/DT dance/NN compendium/NN that/WDT opened/VBD last/JJ season/NN at/IN a/DT cost/NN of/IN more/JJR than/IN $/$ 8/CD million/CD ./. 
At/IN capacity/NN the/DT show/NN grosses/VBZ $/$ 530,000/CD per/IN week/NN ,/, but/CC its/PP$ expenses/NNS are/VBP around/IN $/$ 420,000/CD a/DT week/NN ./. 
It/PP does/VBZ n't/RB take/VB very/RB sophisticated/JJ arithmetic/NN to/TO realize/VB that/IN it/PP will/MD be/VB 75/CD or/CC 80/CD weeks/NNS playing/VBG to/TO full/JJ houses/NNS before/IN the/DT show/NN pays/VBZ back/RB its/PP$ initial/JJ capitalization/NN ,/, let/VB alone/RB makes/VBZ a/DT profit/NN ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ significant/JJ ,/, too/RB ,/, that/IN of/IN the/DT many/JJ offerings/NNS this/DT fall/NN only/RB one/CD ,/, ``/`` A/DT Few/JJ Good/JJ Men/NNS ,/, ''/'' is/VBZ a/DT new/JJ play/NN by/IN an/DT American/JJ playwright/NN ./. 
Given/VBN this/DT fact/NN and/CC the/DT continuing/VBG high/JJ costs/NNS of/IN all/DT productions/NNS ,/, both/DT straight/JJ plays/NNS and/CC musicals/NNS ,/, the/DT problems/NNS that/WDT have/VBP beset/VBN the/DT theater/NN are/VBP still/RB very/RB much/JJ with/IN us/PP ./. 
Some/DT of/IN them/PP may/MD appear/VB intractable/JJ ,/, but/CC others/NNS are/VBP the/DT result/NN of/IN pure/JJ stubbornness/NN and/CC lack/NN of/IN vision/NN ./. 
For/IN example/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP the/DT smaller/JJR Broadway/NP houses/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT Lyceum/NP ,/, the/DT Belasco/NP ,/, the/DT Cort/NP and/CC the/DT Ritz/NP ./. 
Officially/RB designated/VBN by/IN both/DT unions/NNS and/CC producers/NNS as/IN ``/`` endangered/JJ theaters/NNS ,/, ''/'' they/PP are/VBP victims/NNS of/IN an/DT arbitrary/JJ division/NN between/IN Broadway/NP and/CC off-Broadway/NP ./. 
Even/RB with/IN certain/JJ union/NN concessions/NNS ,/, cost/NN remain/VB so/RB much/RB higher/JJR on/IN Broadway/NP than/IN off/IN that/DT today/NN 's/POS young/JJ ,/, independent/JJ producers/NNS find/VBP it/PP more/RBR profitable/JJ to/TO produce/VB straight/JJ plays/NNS in/IN smaller/JJR off-Broadway/NN houses/NNS ./. 
If/IN everyone/NN got/VBD together/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, to/TO effect/VB a/DT compromise/NN ,/, the/DT endangered/JJ Broadway/NP houses/NNS could/MD be/VB filled/VBN with/IN plays/NNS like/IN ``/`` Driving/VBG Miss/NP Daisy/NP ''/'' and/CC ``/`` Other/JJ People/NNS 's/POS Money/NN ''/'' rather/RB than/IN standing/VBG empty/RB ./. 
Several/JJ formulas/NNS have/VBP been/VBN suggested/VBN to/TO solve/VB this/DT problem/NN ,/, but/CC so/RB far/RB no/DT driving/JJ force/NN or/CC catalytic/JJ agent/NN has/VBZ appeared/VBN to/TO bring/VB it/PP about/RP ./. 
Even/RB so/RB ,/, those/DT who/WP care/VBP about/IN the/DT theater/NN can/MD revel/VB in/IN this/DT fall/NN harvest/NN ./. 
The/DT theater/NN ,/, like/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN ,/, thrives/VBZ on/IN optimism/NN ;/: perhaps/RB this/DT burst/NN of/IN activity/NN will/MD become/VB a/DT self-fulfilling/JJ prophecy/NN and/CC producers/NNS who/WP were/VBD ready/JJ to/TO despair/VB will/MD sally/VB forth/RB despite/IN the/DT odds/NNS ./.

Upon/IN checking/VBG with/IN our/PP$ attorneys/NNS and/CC local/JJ law-enforcement/NN officials/NNS ,/, we/PP were/VBD amazed/JJ to/TO learn/VB that/IN while/IN this/DT constituted/VBD a/DT crime/NN under/IN the/DT California/NP Penal/NP Code/NP ,/, the/DT statute/NN simply/RB is/VBZ not/RB enforced/VBN ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ true/JJ ,/, as/RB pointed/VBN out/RB in/IN your/PP$ article/NN ,/, that/IN open/JJ adoption/NN is/VBZ ,/, first/RB and/CC last/RB ,/, an/DT exercise/NN in/IN trust/NN for/IN all/DT concerned/VBN ./.

Columbia/NP 's/POS employees/NNS ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, are/VBP said/VBN to/TO be/VB quite/RB apprehensive/JJ about/IN the/DT prospect/NN of/IN working/VBG for/IN Japanese/JJ owners/NNS ./.

How/WRB will/MD they/PP adapt/VBP to/TO this/DT new/JJ style/NN ?/. 
In/IN 1986/CD ,/, I/PP was/VBD part/NN of/IN the/DT Japanese/JJ team/NN that/WDT established/VBD the/DT Panasonic/NP subsidiary/NN Kotobuki/NP Electronics/NP Industries/NPS ,/, in/IN Vancouver/NP ,/, Wash/NP ./. 
When/WRB we/PP celebrated/VBD our/PP$ first/JJ anniversary/NN ,/, I/PP asked/VBD our/PP$ American/JJ employees/NNS how/WRB they/PP enjoyed/VBD working/VBG with/IN us/PP ./. 
For/IN the/DT most/JJS part/NN they/PP were/VBD happy/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PP was/VBD surprised/JJ by/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT criticisms/NNS they/PP made/VBD :/: --/: Japanese/JJ managers/NNS do/VBP n't/RB trust/VB American/JJ workers/NNS and/CC are/VBP too/RB secretive/JJ ./. 
--/: American/JJ managers/NNS have/VBP many/JJ responsibilities/NNS but/CC little/JJ decision-making/NN authority/NN ./. 
--/: The/DT Japanese/NPS do/VB not/RB give/VB their/PP$ employees/NNS clear/JJ job/NN descriptions/NNS ./. 
--/: Japanese/JJ management/NN is/VBZ too/RB slow/JJ to/TO make/VB decisions/NNS ./. 
--/: Japanese/JJ managers/NNS are/VBP too/RB negative/JJ ;/: they/PP criticize/VBP but/CC never/RB praise/VBP ./. 
I/PP had/VBD n't/RB realized/VBN until/IN then/RB that/IN my/PP$ American/JJ workers/NNS were/VBD experiencing/VBG culture/NN shock/NN ./. 
Culture/NN shock/NN in/IN the/DT work/NN context/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT source/NN of/IN damaging/VBG misunderstandings/NNS and/CC intolerable/JJ frustrations/NNS ./. 
It/PP became/VBD clear/JJ to/TO me/PP that/IN I/PP had/VBD a/DT formidable/JJ management/NN challenge/NN to/TO communicate/VB the/DT reasons/NNS for/IN our/PP$ Japanese/JJ ways/NNS to/TO our/PP$ American/JJ employees/NNS ./. 
Culture/NN has/VBZ two/CD aspects/NNS ./. 
One/CD is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO understand/VB because/IN it/PP is/VBZ clear/JJ to/TO see/VB ./. 
Foreigners/NNS recognize/VBP it/PP in/IN the/DT etiquette/NN ,/, customs/NNS ,/, trade/NN practices/NNS ,/, folklore/NN and/CC all/PDT the/DT various/JJ objective/JJ products/NNS and/CC behaviors/NNS of/IN a/DT culture/NN ./. 
The/DT other/JJ aspect/NN is/VBZ less/RBR easy/JJ to/TO understand/VB because/IN it/PP requires/VBZ a/DT foreigner/NN to/TO enter/VB deeply/RB into/IN the/DT subjective/JJ reality/NN of/IN an/DT unfamiliar/JJ culture/NN ./. 
One/PP needs/VBZ to/TO understand/VB the/DT reasons/NNS behind/IN its/PP$ people/NNS 's/POS behavior/NN ./. 
Why/WRB do/VBP they/PP think/VB the/DT way/NN they/PP do/VBP ?/. 
What/WP are/VBP their/PP$ deepest/JJS values/NNS ?/. 
Our/PP$ American/JJ employees/NNS were/VBD not/RB having/VBG difficulties/NNS with/IN our/PP$ Japanese/JJ management/NN on/IN the/DT first/JJ level/NN ,/, but/CC on/IN the/DT second/NN ./. 
They/PP needed/VBD to/TO better/RBR understand/VB our/PP$ way/NN of/IN thinking/NN and/CC our/PP$ values/NNS ./. 
I/PP realized/VBD I/PP needed/VBD to/TO better/RBR understand/VB these/DT things/NNS myself/PP ./. 
So/RB much/RB of/IN one/PP 's/POS culture/NN is/VBZ taken/VBN for/IN granted/VBN ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ like/IN the/DT air/NN we/PP breathe/VBP --/: always/RB there/EX supporting/VBG our/PP$ life/NN ,/, but/CC rarely/RB thought/VBD about/IN ./. 
So/RB here/RB is/VBZ my/PP$ attempt/NN to/TO explain/VB the/DT values/NNS behind/IN the/DT Japanese/JJ management/NN style/NN ,/, a/DT style/NN that/IN I/PP hope/VBP will/MD be/VB easier/JJR for/IN Americans/NPS to/TO live/VB with/IN if/IN they/PP understand/VBP the/DT cultural/JJ reasons/NNS behind/IN it/PP ./. 
Do/VBP Japanese/JJ managers/NNS mistrust/VB Americans/NPS and/CC keep/VB secrets/NNS from/IN them/PP ?/. 
I/PP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB so/RB ./. 
The/DT problem/NN lies/VBZ more/RBR in/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, in/IN American/JJ terms/NNS ,/, the/DT Japanese/NPS are/VBP simply/RB poor/JJ communicators/NNS ./. 
In/IN Japanese/JJ culture/NN silence/NN is/VBZ golden/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT real/JJ messages/NNS are/VBP often/RB communicated/VBN nonverbally/RB ./. 
Japanese/NPS speak/VBP with/IN great/JJ reserve/NN ,/, and/CC their/PP$ messages/NNS are/VBP often/RB communicated/VBN subtly/RB ./. 
Japanese/NPS value/VBP a/DT listener/NN who/WP uses/VBZ his/PP$ perceptiveness/NN to/TO understand/VB the/DT speaker/NN 's/POS meaning/NN ./. 
From/IN a/DT small/JJ bit/NN of/IN information/NN --/: perhaps/RB from/IN a/DT simple/JJ gesture/NN or/CC the/DT speaker/NN 's/POS tone/NN of/IN voice/NN --/: the/DT Japanese/JJ listener/NN gleans/VBZ the/DT whole/JJ meaning/NN ./. 
The/DT Japanese/NPS have/VBP learned/VBN from/IN a/DT very/RB early/JJ age/NN how/WRB to/TO understand/VB one/CD another/DT without/IN direct/JJ verbal/JJ communication/NN ./. 
Americans/NPS understandably/RB interpret/VBP this/DT behavior/NN as/IN secretive/JJ ,/, and/CC they/PP think/VBP that/IN Japanese/NPS consciously/RB withhold/VBP information/NN because/IN they/PP do/VBP n't/RB trust/VB them/PP ./. 
I/PP think/VBP the/DT problem/NN lies/VBZ rather/RB on/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN a/DT misunderstanding/NN because/IN of/IN different/JJ communication/NN styles/NNS ./. 
But/CC perhaps/RB Americans/NPS also/RB feel/VBP mistrusted/JJ because/IN they/PP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB the/DT authority/NN that/IN the/DT same/JJ level/NN of/IN responsibility/NN or/CC job/NN title/NN would/MD give/VB them/PP in/IN an/DT American/JJ company/NN ./. 
Again/RB this/DT has/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN Japanese/JJ mistrust/NN ./. 
Authority/NN to/TO make/VB decisions/NNS is/VBZ shared/VBN in/IN Japanese/JJ companies/NNS in/IN ways/NNS Americans/NPS are/VBP unused/JJ to/TO ./. 
And/CC whether/IN a/DT manager/NN is/VBZ American/JJ or/CC Japanese/JJ ,/, the/DT authority/NN he/PP is/VBZ granted/VBN is/VBZ more/JJR a/DT function/NN of/IN time/NN than/IN of/IN his/PP$ job/NN title/NN ./. 
Authority/NN is/VBZ a/DT reward/NN for/IN loyalty/NN and/CC a/DT consistent/JJ demonstration/NN of/IN responsibility/NN ./. 
Before/IN being/VBG promoted/VBN to/TO manager/NN ,/, Japanese/JJ employees/NNS are/VBP assigned/VBN to/TO different/JJ departments/NNS over/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN 10/CD to/TO 15/CD years/NNS ./. 
During/IN this/DT time/NN they/PP work/VBP alongside/IN many/JJ different/JJ people/NNS to/TO give/VB them/PP the/DT chance/NN to/TO develop/VB extensive/JJ working/NN relationships/NNS based/VBN on/IN trust/NN and/CC respect/NN ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ why/WRB job/NN descriptions/NNS are/VBP not/RB specific/JJ ;/: a/DT manager/NN in/IN a/DT Japanese/JJ company/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT generalist/NN ,/, an/DT all-round/JJ player/NN ./. 
At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT long/JJ process/NN ,/, a/DT manager/NN --/: whether/IN Japanese/JJ or/CC American/JJ --/: is/VBZ granted/VBN a/DT degree/NN of/IN authority/NN because/IN he/PP has/VBZ proven/VBN himself/PP trustworthy/JJ ./. 
But/CC even/RB when/WRB a/DT manager/NN earns/VBZ this/DT trust/NN ,/, he/PP is/VBZ rarely/RB given/VBN the/DT kind/NN of/IN individual/JJ authority/NN that/WDT is/VBZ common/JJ in/IN American/JJ companies/NNS ./. 
Americans/NPS value/VBP an/DT aggressive/JJ ,/, quick/JJ ,/, individualistic/JJ decision-making/NN style/NN ./. 
But/CC for/IN the/DT Japanese/NPS it/PP is/VBZ more/RBR important/JJ to/TO have/VB consensus/NN than/IN to/TO have/VB a/DT quick/JJ decision/NN ./. 
Working/VBG relationships/NNS in/IN Japanese/JJ companies/NNS are/VBP long-term/JJ ,/, and/CC loyalty/NN ,/, cooperation/NN ,/, and/CC harmonious/JJ interpersonal/JJ relationships/NNS are/VBP very/RB important/JJ ./. 
A/DT participative/JJ management/NN style/NN has/VBZ developed/VBN in/IN Japan/NP to/TO induce/VB better/JJR cooperation/NN ./. 
This/DT means/VBZ less/RBR individual/JJ authority/NN and/CC a/DT much/RB longer/JJR decision-making/NN process/NN than/IN Americans/NPS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO ./. 
In/IN this/DT system/NN the/DT nail/NN that/WDT sticks/VBZ out/RB tends/VBZ to/TO get/VB hammered/VBN down/RB ./. 
Maybe/RB some/DT Americans/NPS who/WP were/VBD used/VBN to/TO standing/VBG out/RB and/CC who/WP expected/VBD praise/NN as/IN a/DT result/NN were/VBD bewildered/JJ when/WRB no/DT praise/NN came/VBD ./. 
But/CC it/PP is/VBZ important/JJ for/IN Americans/NPS to/TO understand/VB that/IN Japanese/NPS rarely/RB praise/VBP others/NNS because/IN they/PP are/VBP uncomfortable/JJ when/WRB others/NNS praise/VBP them/PP ./. 
Praise/NN is/VBZ confused/VBN with/IN flattery/NN ,/, and/CC flattery/NN is/VBZ a/DT cause/NN of/IN mistrust/NN ./. 
Japanese/JJ children/NNS are/VBP raised/VBN in/IN a/DT way/NN many/JJ Americans/NPS would/MD find/VB severe/JJ ./. 
After/IN a/DT wonderfully/RB frivolous/JJ early/JJ childhood/NN ,/, they/PP are/VBP exposed/VBN to/TO rigid/JJ discipline/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN they/PP enter/VBP school/NN ./. 
They/PP are/VBP continuously/RB indoctrinated/VBN to/TO avoid/VB shame/NN and/CC disgrace/NN ./. 
They/PP know/VBP they/PP are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO do/VB well/RB ,/, and/CC they/PP do/VBP not/RB expect/VB to/TO be/VB praised/VBN unless/IN their/PP$ work/NN is/VBZ truly/RB outstanding/JJ ./. 
Perhaps/RB one/PP could/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT Japanese/NPS are/VBP motivated/VBN more/RBR by/IN fear/NN of/IN shame/NN than/IN by/IN desire/NN for/IN praise/NN ,/, but/CC there/EX is/VBZ also/RB a/DT profound/JJ desire/NN to/TO excel/VB and/CC to/TO do/VB a/DT better/JJR job/NN ./. 
For/IN this/DT reason/NN the/DT Japanese/NPS always/RB look/VBP for/IN a/DT better/JJR way/NN to/TO do/VB something/NN ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT motive/NN for/IN criticism/NN --/: not/RB to/TO be/VB negative/JJ ,/, but/CC to/TO find/VB a/DT better/JJR way/NN ./. 
So/RB there/EX is/VBZ an/DT understandable/JJ truth/NN at/IN the/DT root/NN of/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT American/JJ criticisms/NNS ./. 
The/DT Japanese/NPS do/VBP not/RB communicate/VB clearly/RB ./. 
They/PP do/VBP not/RB give/VB much/JJ individual/JJ authority/NN ./. 
They/PP make/VBP decisions/NNS slowly/RB ./. 
They/PP do/VBP not/RB praise/VB ./. 
But/CC there/EX are/VBP deep/JJ cultural/JJ reasons/NNS for/IN these/DT behaviors/NNS and/CC policies/NNS --/: not/RB an/DT anti-American/JJ bias/NN ./. 
Mr./NP Kageyama/NP is/VBZ president/NN of/IN American/NP Kotobuki/NP Electronics/NP Industries/NPS ,/, a/DT subsidiary/NN of/IN Panasonic/NP ./. 
Hudson/NP General/NP Corp./NP said/VBD it/PP will/MD omit/VB its/PP$ semiannual/JJ dividend/NN because/IN its/PP$ net/JJ worth/NN has/VBZ fallen/VBN below/IN the/DT limit/NN allowed/VBN under/IN amendments/NNS to/TO a/DT $/$ 35/CD million/CD revolving/VBG credit/NN accord/NN ./.

``/`` Drug/NN Kingpin/NN ''/'' is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT worst/JJS label/NN you/PP can/MD pin/VB on/IN anyone/NN these/DT days/NNS ./.

If/IN we/PP do/VBP n't/RB need/VB a/DT tax/NN increase/NN we/PP do/VBP n't/RB need/VB any/DT of/IN that/DT ,/, and/CC if/IN we/PP do/VBP need/VB a/DT tax/NN increase/NN we/PP need/VBP a/DT lot/RB more/JJR than/IN that/DT ./.

In/IN my/PP$ opinion/NN ,/, we/PP need/VBP $/$ 50/CD billion/CD to/TO $/$ 100/CD billion/CD in/IN annual/JJ new/JJ taxes/NNS ./.

The/DT deficit-debt/NN problem/NN is/VBZ large/JJ ./. 
In/IN 1985/CD Congress/NP and/CC the/DT president/NN hailed/VBD the/DT new/JJ Gramm-Rudman-Hollings/NP Act/NP as/IN evidence/NN of/IN the/DT nation/NN 's/POS determination/NN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT deficit/NN ./.

These/DT steps/NNS would/MD have/VB left/VBN a/DT deficit/NN of/IN $/$ 532/CD billion/CD for/IN the/DT fiscal/JJ years/NNS 1986/CD through/IN 1990/CD ./. 
Even/RB on/IN the/DT administration/NN 's/POS estimates/NNS for/IN 1989/CD and/CC 1990/CD ,/, the/DT combined/VBN deficit/NN for/IN those/DT years/NNS is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB about/IN $/$ 240/CD billion/CD ,/, or/CC 45/CD %/NN ,/, above/IN the/DT target/NN ./.

In/IN 1974/CD the/DT federal/JJ debt/NN held/VBN outside/IN the/DT Social/NP Security/NP trust/NN accounts/NNS was/VBD 24/CD %/NN of/IN GNP/NP ./.

The/DT proposal/NN sounds/VBZ like/IN a/DT big/JJ break/NN for/IN stockholders/NNS ./. 
That/DT depends/VBZ on/IN your/PP$ point/NN of/IN view/NN ./. 
The/DT fruits/NNS of/IN being/VBG an/DT owner/NN of/IN a/DT U.S./NP corporation/NN are/VBP now/RB taxed/VBN three/CD ways/NNS by/IN the/DT federal/JJ government/NN ./. 
First/RB ,/, the/DT income/NN of/IN the/DT corporation/NN is/VBZ taxed/VBN ./. 
Then/RB that/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT corporation/NN 's/POS income/NN that/WDT is/VBZ paid/VBN to/TO shareholders/NNS as/IN dividends/NNS is/VBZ taxed/VBN a/DT second/JJ time/NN when/WRB those/DT shareholders/NNS pay/VBP their/PP$ income/NN taxes/NNS ./. 
Then/RB fruits/NNS are/VBP taxed/VBN a/DT third/JJ time/NN indirectly/RB when/WRB ownership/NN is/VBZ transferred/VBN ./. 
That/DT 's/VBZ the/DT capital/NN gains/NNS tax/NN ,/, which/WDT purports/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT tax/NN on/IN income/NN but/CC is/VBZ n't/RB ./. 
What/WP it/PP is/VBZ ,/, first/RB of/IN all/DT ,/, is/VBZ a/DT tax/NN on/IN inflationary/JJ gains/NNS in/IN wealth/NN ./. 
The/DT current/JJ congressional/JJ debate/NN at/IN least/JJS includes/VBZ proposals/NNS to/TO address/VB the/DT inflation/NN problem/NN ./. 
But/CC taxing/VBG non-inflationary/JJ gains/NNS in/IN wealth/NN is/VBZ just/RB as/RB unfair/JJ ./. 
Income/NN arises/VBZ from/IN the/DT production/NN and/CC sale/NN of/IN a/DT good/NN or/CC service/NN ./. 
When/WRB ownership/NN is/VBZ transferred/VBN ,/, the/DT only/JJ service/NN performed/VBN is/VBZ brokering/VBG ./. 
The/DT brokerage/NN firm/NN 's/POS commission/NN is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ income/NN ./. 
The/DT person/NN selling/VBG the/DT shares/NNS has/VBZ n't/RB produced/VBD anything/NN ./. 
The/DT seller/NN is/VBZ only/RB relinquishing/VBG his/PP$ or/CC her/PP$ claim/NN on/IN the/DT future/JJ dividends/NNS of/IN the/DT corporation/NN and/CC obtaining/VBG money/NN ./. 
The/DT buyer/NN is/VBZ doing/VBG the/DT opposite/NN ./. 
Neither/DT is/VBZ generating/VBG (/( or/CC realizing/VBG )/) income/NN ./. 
And/CC after/IN the/DT transaction/NN ,/, only/RB the/DT seller/NN ,/, by/IN using/VBG the/DT proceeds/NNS of/IN the/DT sale/NN ,/, can/MD requisition/VB goods/NNS and/CC services/NNS for/IN his/PP$ use/NN ./. 
The/DT buyer/NN has/VBZ transferred/VBN to/TO the/DT seller/NN the/DT ability/NN to/TO buy/VB goods/NNS and/CC services/NNS ./. 
So/RB what/WP we/PP have/VBP with/IN the/DT present/JJ tax/NN on/IN capital/NN gains/NNS is/VBZ a/DT discriminatory/JJ tax/NN on/IN wealth/NN ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ a/DT tax/NN on/IN wealth/NN only/RB when/WRB it/PP is/VBZ transferred/VBN ,/, and/CC then/RB only/RB on/IN any/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT nominal/JJ monetary/JJ value/NN of/IN an/DT asset/NN during/IN the/DT time/NN the/DT seller/NN held/VBD the/DT asset/NN ./. 
Relating/VBG income/NN to/TO the/DT flow/NN of/IN goods/NNS and/CC services/NNS ,/, as/IN I/PP do/VBP ,/, is/VBZ consistent/JJ with/IN the/DT definition/NN of/IN income/NN in/IN the/DT GNP/NP accounts/NNS ./. 
When/WRB a/DT gain/NN in/IN the/DT value/NN of/IN a/DT financial/JJ asset/NN reflects/VBZ an/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT income/NN stream/NN associated/VBN with/IN the/DT asset/NN ,/, the/DT tax/NN system/NN captures/VBZ part/NN of/IN that/DT increased/VBN regular/JJ income/NN ./. 
Of/IN course/NN ,/, not/RB all/DT gains/NNS reflect/VBP increases/NNS in/IN associated/JJ income/NN ./. 
A/DT capital/NN gain/NN can/MD reflect/VB only/RB the/DT revaluing/NN of/IN an/DT unchanged/JJ stream/NN of/IN income/NN --/: a/DT change/NN in/IN the/DT discount/NN rate/NN applied/VBN to/TO the/DT income/NN ./. 
In/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT income/NN involved/VBN ./. 
And/CC any/DT ``/`` gain/NN ''/'' to/TO the/DT seller/NN from/IN buying/VBG the/DT asset/NN ,/, say/VB ,/, in/IN January/NP and/CC selling/VBG it/PP in/IN June/NP may/MD be/VB said/VBD to/TO offset/VB the/DT ``/`` loss/NN ''/'' to/TO the/DT buyer/NN of/IN having/VBG waited/VBN until/IN June/NP to/TO purchase/VB the/DT asset/NN ./. 
It/PP follows/VBZ that/IN taxing/VBG income/NN directly/RB and/CC only/RB once/RB means/VBZ that/IN shareholders/NNS ,/, not/RB corporations/NNS ,/, pay/VBP taxes/NNS on/IN net/JJ income/NN ./. 
A/DT corollary/NN is/VBZ to/TO stop/VB taxing/VBG capital/NN gains/NNS and/CC stop/VB allowing/VBG deductions/NNS for/IN capital/NN losses/NNS that/WDT arise/VBP from/IN transfers/NNS of/IN financial/JJ assets/NNS ./. 
Only/RB the/DT flow/NN of/IN a/DT corporation/NN 's/POS income/NN and/CC loss/NN will/MD show/VB up/RB on/IN individual/JJ tax/NN returns/NNS ,/, along/IN with/IN wages/NNS ,/, salaries/NNS ,/, rents/NNS ,/, and/CC so/RB forth/RB ./. 
Under/IN this/DT system/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT corporation/NN loses/VBZ the/DT money/NN it/PP received/VBD from/IN selling/VBG stock/NN or/CC the/DT earnings/NNS it/PP reinvested/VBD ,/, each/DT shareholder/NN reports/VBZ his/PP$ proportionate/JJ share/NN of/IN the/DT loss/NN on/IN his/PP$ tax/NN return/NN ./. 
When/WRB the/DT corporation/NN earns/VBZ money/NN ,/, each/DT shareholder/NN reports/VBZ his/PP$ proportionate/JJ share/NN of/IN the/DT earnings/NNS on/IN his/PP$ tax/NN return/NN (/( or/CC ,/, alternatively/RB ,/, gets/VBZ a/DT credit/NN for/IN the/DT income/NN tax/NN the/DT corporation/NN paid/VBD )/) ./. 
Gains/NNS and/CC losses/NNS from/IN the/DT trading/NN of/IN financial/JJ assets/NNS would/MD be/VB ,/, respectively/RB ,/, neither/DT taxable/JJ nor/CC deductible/JJ ./. 
If/IN the/DT government/NN ca/MD n't/RB resist/VB taxing/VBG the/DT fruits/NNS of/IN ownership/NN more/JJR than/IN once/RB ,/, it/PP could/MD still/RB eliminate/VB the/DT double/JJ taxation/NN of/IN dividends/NNS ,/, as/IN recommended/VBN above/RB ,/, and/CC consider/VB replacing/VBG the/DT present/JJ tax/NN on/IN realized/JJ capital/NN gains/NNS with/IN a/DT tax/NN on/IN all/DT financial/JJ wealth/NN whose/WP$ value/NN can/MD be/VB readily/RB ascertained/VBN or/CC reasonably/RB imputed/VBN ./.

For/IN veteran/JJ Mexico-watchers/NNS accustomed/VBN to/TO conflict-ridden/JJ summits/NNS ,/, the/DT clear/JJ sailing/NN is/VBZ refreshing/JJ ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, the/DT economic/JJ discussions/NNS will/MD be/VB shaped/VBN by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN banks/NNS seem/VBP inclined/VBN to/TO select/VB the/DT principal/NN and/CC interest/NN reduction/NN options/NNS of/IN the/DT Brady/NP Plan/NP ,/, reducing/VBG the/DT likelihood/NN of/IN large/JJ sums/NNS of/IN fresh/JJ money/NN flowing/VBG to/TO Mexico/NP ./.

The/DT jarring/VBG note/NN in/IN this/DT symphony/NN is/VBZ the/DT sobering/VBG thought/NN that/IN Mexico/NP 's/POS historic/JJ economic/JJ experiment/NN rests/VBZ on/IN a/DT fragile/JJ political/JJ base/NN ./.

If/IN they/PP 'd/MD rather/RB dine/VB on/IN a/DT day/NN in/IN November/NP ,/, too/RB late/RB ./.

It/PP is/VBZ thought/VBN to/TO be/VB the/DT smallest/JJS restaurant/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, unless/IN somewhere/RB out/IN there/EX there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT one-stooler/NN ./. 
Time/NN was/VBD that/IN habitues/NNS of/IN the/DT table/NN could/MD reserve/VB for/IN lunch/NN just/RB a/DT week/NN in/IN advance/NN ./. 
Then/RB a/DT newspaper/NN restaurant/NN reviewer/NN published/VBD his/PP$ opinion/NN that/IN the/DT food/NN here/RB was/VBD the/DT best/JJS in/IN town/NN ./. 
By/IN 1:30/CD that/DT afternoon/NN ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD booked/VBN for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN ./. 
Owners/NNS Nancy/NP Briggs/NP and/CC Juanita/NP Crampton/NP started/VBD the/DT restaurant/NN four/CD years/NNS ago/RB as/IN a/DT sideline/NN to/TO their/PP$ catering/NN firm/NN ,/, Briggs/NP &/CC Crampton/NP ./. 
The/DT reasoning/NN was/VBD simple/JJ :/: Since/IN they/PP hired/VBD servers/NNS and/CC were/VBD never/RB present/JJ at/IN their/PP$ catered/JJ events/NNS ,/, they/PP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB to/TO hear/VB the/DT yummy/JJ noises/NNS from/IN people/NNS who/WP ate/VBD their/PP$ food/NN ./. 
But/CC yummy/JJ noises/NNS from/IN two/CD people/NNS per/IN day/NN ,/, sometimes/RB going/VBG on/RP for/IN hours/NNS and/CC hours/NNS depending/VBG on/IN their/PP$ rate/NN of/IN consumption/NN ,/, was/VBD about/IN all/DT the/DT women/NNS could/MD take/VB ./. 
Pleas/NNS from/IN customers/NNS to/TO add/VB another/DT table/NN ,/, or/CC at/IN least/JJS another/DT chair/NN ,/, go/VBP unheeded/JJ ./. 
Some/DT customers/NNS ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, are/VBP willing/JJ to/TO wait/VB months/NNS just/RB for/IN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO dine/VB without/IN hearing/VBG noises/NNS of/IN any/DT sort/NN from/IN other/JJ diners/NNS ./. 
Another/DT attraction/NN of/IN the/DT place/NN is/VBZ the/DT absence/NN of/IN anyone/NN who/WP pops/VBZ by/RB to/TO inquire/VB ,/, ``/`` How/WRB we/PP doin/VBG '/'' ?/. 
''/'' My/PP$ lunch/NN companion/NN said/VBD the/DT wait/NN was/VBD worth/IN it/PP just/RB to/TO know/VB she/PP 'd/MD be/VB spared/VBN a/DT waiter/NN who/WP would/MD spread/VB a/DT napkin/NN in/IN her/PP$ lap/NN ./. 
Ms./NP Briggs/NP and/CC Ms./NP Crampton/NP speak/VBP sparingly/RB to/TO their/PP$ two/CD daily/JJ customers/NNS ,/, except/IN to/TO identify/VB the/DT food/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ always/RB a/DT surprise/NN ./. 
Although/IN they/PP will/MD take/VB requests/NNS ,/, they/PP prefer/VBP simply/RB to/TO know/VB what/WDT foods/NNS their/PP$ customers/NNS wo/MD n't/RB eat/VB ,/, and/CC then/RB steer/VBP around/IN them/PP ./. 
I/PP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, informed/VBD them/PP ahead/RB of/IN time/NN that/IN I/PP would/MD refuse/VB to/TO eat/VB liver/NN and/CC lima/NN beans/NNS ,/, no/DT matter/NN how/WRB elegant/JJ the/DT presentation/NN ./. 
Presumably/RB then/RB they/PP ditched/VBD all/DT their/PP$ liver/NN and/CC lima/NN bean/NN recipes/NNS and/CC instead/RB served/VBD me/PP a/DT delectable/JJ filet/NN of/IN salmon/NN with/IN blackberry-basil/NN sauce/NN ./. 
In/IN four/CD years/NNS of/IN serving/VBG gourmet/JJ lunches/NNS four/CD times/NNS a/DT week/NN ,/, Ms./NP Briggs/NP and/CC Ms./NP Crampton/NP have/VBP never/RB done/VBN the/DT same/JJ meal/NN twice/RB ./. 
They/PP rarely/RB serve/VBP red/JJ meat/NN ,/, preferring/VBG to/TO prepare/VB seafood/NN ,/, poultry/NN or/CC game/NN birds/NNS ./. 
Other/JJ than/IN liver/NN and/CC lima/NN beans/NNS ,/, the/DT most/RBS frequently/RB eschewed/VBN foods/NNS have/VBP been/VBN shellfish/NNS and/CC oysters/NNS ,/, although/IN there/EX was/VBD one/CD couple/NN who/WP requested/VBD that/IN oysters/NNS be/VB in/IN every/DT course/NN of/IN their/PP$ meal/NN ./. 
Ms./NP Briggs/NP and/CC Ms./NP Crampton/NP have/VBP found/VBN that/IN there/EX are/VBP certain/JJ drawbacks/NNS to/TO their/PP$ tiny/JJ restaurant/NN 's/POS enormous/JJ acclaim/NN ./. 
For/IN one/CD thing/NN ,/, the/DT place/NN is/VBZ such/JJ a/DT hit/NN that/IN Ms./NP Briggs/NP 's/POS husband/NN ,/, who/WP used/VBD to/TO hold/VB the/DT title/NN of/IN most/RBS frequent/JJ guest/NN (/( probably/RB just/RB checking/VBG to/TO see/VB what/WDT leftovers/NNS he/PP 'd/MD be/VB eating/VBG that/DT night/NN )/) ,/, rarely/RB gets/VBZ to/TO eat/VB at/IN his/PP$ favorite/JJ restaurant/NN anymore/RB ./. 
``/`` He/PP has/VBZ to/TO get/VB in/IN line/NN like/IN everyone/NN else/RB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD his/PP$ wife/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT helpless/JJ shrug/NN ./. 
Obviously/RB ,/, at/IN this/DT place/NN ,/, it/PP does/VBZ n't/RB matter/VB whom/WP you/PP know/VBP ./. 
Another/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/DT most/JJS of/IN the/DT customers/NNS are/VBP total/JJ strangers/NNS to/TO Ms./NP Briggs/NP and/CC Ms./NP Crampton/NP ./. 
It/PP used/VBD to/TO be/VB that/RB only/JJ their/PP$ friends/NNS ,/, or/CC friends/NNS of/IN friends/NNS ,/, frequented/VBD the/DT place/NN ,/, so/IN the/DT two/CD chefs/NNS never/RB felt/VBD shy/RB about/IN unleashing/VBG their/PP$ culinary/JJ derring/NN do/NN ./. 
``/`` We/PP 've/VBP had/VBN some/DT pretty/RB bizarre/JJ lunches/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN fun/NN ,/, ''/'' reminisced/VBD Ms./NP Crampton/NP ./.

Their/PP$ guests/NNS smacked/VBD them/PP right/RB up/RB ./.

Some/DT customers/NNS come/VBP to/TO Table/NP for/IN Two/NP only/RB because/IN they/PP 've/VBP heard/VBN it/PP 's/VBZ terrific/JJ for/IN a/DT tryst/NN ./. 
They/PP barely/RB notice/VBP the/DT stunning/JJ displays/NNS of/IN food/NN that/WDT are/VBP placed/VBN before/IN them/PP ./. 
Clearly/RB ,/, their/PP$ minds/NNS are/VBP not/RB on/IN their/PP$ plates/NNS ./. 
``/`` More/JJR than/IN one/CD person/NN has/VBZ asked/VBN us/PP if/IN we/PP have/VBP a/DT room/NN upstairs/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Ms./NP Briggs/NP ./.

)/) As/RB far/RB as/IN I/PP could/MD determine/VB there/EX is/VBZ no/DT room/NN upstairs/NN ,/, but/CC it/PP does/VBZ n't/RB rile/VB the/DT chefs/NNS when/WRB folks/NNS express/VBP their/PP$ urge/NN for/IN hanky/NN panky/NN ,/, just/RB as/RB long/RB as/IN they/PP do/VBP it/PP on/IN a/DT full/JJ stomach/NN ./. 
Ms./NP Briggs/NP and/CC Ms./NP Crampton/NP admit/VBP to/TO getting/VBG hurt/JJ feelings/NNS if/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN food/NN is/VBZ left/VBN untouched/JJ ./. 
And/CC ,/, unlike/IN your/PP$ mother/NN ,/, they/PP do/VBP n't/RB object/VB to/TO the/DT occasional/JJ customer/NN who/WP picks/VBZ up/RP the/DT plate/NN and/CC licks/VBZ it/PP ./. 
What/WP peeves/VBZ them/PP most/RBS is/VBZ when/WRB a/DT guest/NN is/VBZ totally/RB oblivious/JJ to/TO the/DT food/NN ,/, like/IN the/DT oaf/NN who/WP managed/VBD to/TO insult/VB both/DT the/DT chefs/NNS and/CC his/PP$ date/NN by/IN spending/VBG the/DT entire/JJ time/NN yakking/VBG on/IN his/PP$ cellular/JJ phone/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN after/IN the/DT Burmese/JJ government/NN launched/VBD a/DT reign/NN of/IN terror/NN in/IN the/DT summer/NN of/IN 1988/CD ,/, 8,000/CD to/TO 10,000/CD Burmese/NNS fled/VBD to/TO border/NN areas/NNS and/CC into/IN Thailand/NP ./.

A/DT third/JJ difficulty/NN is/VBZ that/IN ,/, for/IN political/JJ reasons/NNS ,/, nations/NNS often/RB do/VBP not/RB disclose/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN refugees/NNS who/WP have/VBP fled/VBN or/CC how/WRB many/JJ from/IN other/JJ countries/NNS reside/VBP within/IN their/PP$ borders/NNS ./. 
While/IN Freedom/NP House/NP has/VBZ found/VBN advances/NNS in/IN political/JJ rights/NNS and/CC civil/JJ liberties/NNS around/IN the/DT world/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, the/DT millions/NNS of/IN refugees/NNS remind/VBP us/PP that/IN significant/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT globe/NN continue/VBP to/TO be/VB marred/VBN by/IN strife/NN ,/, privation/NN and/CC bigotry/NN ./.

Both/DT business/NN and/CC labor/NN groups/NNS complained/VBD that/IN the/DT requirements/NNS of/IN the/DT provision/NN were/VBD too/RB complex/JJ ,/, and/CC businesses/NNS claimed/VBD they/PP would/MD have/VB to/TO pay/VB large/JJ sums/NNS to/TO consultants/NNS ,/, accountants/NNS and/CC attorneys/NNS to/TO understand/VB the/DT mechanics/NNS of/IN the/DT law/NN ./.

Most/JJS here/RB said/VBD the/DT higher/JJR ceiling/NN more/RBR realistically/RB reflects/VBZ the/DT rising/JJ demand/NN for/IN OPEC/NP oil/NN and/CC should/MD help/VB maintain/VB oil/NN prices/NNS at/IN relatively/RB firm/JJ levels/NNS --/: though/IN it/PP is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO have/VB little/JJ effect/NN on/IN actual/JJ output/NN ./. 
OPEC/NP is/VBZ currently/RB producing/VBG about/IN 22/CD million/CD barrels/NNS a/DT day/NN because/IN of/IN widespread/JJ quota/NN cheating/NN ./. 
In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT immediate/JJ response/NN in/IN oil/NN markets/NNS was/VBD bullish/JJ ./.

If/IN nothing/NN else/RB ,/, the/DT new/JJ ceiling/NN will/MD mean/VB that/IN more/JJR of/IN the/DT oil/NN being/NN produced/VBN by/IN the/DT 13/CD nations/NNS will/MD be/VB pumped/VBN under/IN the/DT OPEC/NP umbrella/NN --/: and/CC thus/RB technically/RB reduce/VB cheating/NN by/IN one/CD million/CD barrels/NNS a/DT day/NN ./.

Running/VBG the/DT gamut/NN from/IN wild/JJ ,/, uncontrolled/JJ laughter/NN ,/, to/TO barely/RB concealed/JJ contempt/NN ,/, to/TO tender/VB pathos/NN ,/, Ms./NP Redgrave/NP is/VBZ acting/VBG from/IN her/PP$ inner/JJ gut/NN to/TO the/DT edges/NNS of/IN her/PP$ fingertips/NNS every/DT moment/NN of/IN her/PP$ three-hour/JJ performance/NN ./.

Ms./NP Redgrave/NP affects/VBZ a/DT heavy/JJ Italian/JJ accent/NN one/PP must/MD get/VB past/NN to/TO appreciate/VB the/DT full/JJ measure/NN of/IN her/PP$ accomplishment/NN ./.

Similarly/RB ,/, the/DT real/JJ price/NN of/IN ice/NN to/TO Jones/NP is/VBZ $/$ 301/CD ./.

Almost/RB certainly/RB it/PP is/VBZ because/RB every/DT individual/NN has/VBZ an/DT incentive/NN to/TO alter/VB the/DT distribution/NN of/IN income/NN in/IN his/PP$ favor/NN and/CC most/JJS individuals/NNS have/VBP a/DT distorted/JJ understanding/NN of/IN prices/NNS ./.

In/IN a/DT recent/JJ study/NN ,/, co-authored/VBD with/IN Daniel/NP Feenberg/NP of/IN the/DT National/NP Bureau/NP of/IN Economic/NP Research/NP ,/, I/PP found/VBD support/NN for/IN the/DT view/NN that/IN IRAs/NNS represent/VBP new/JJ savings/NNS ./. 
We/PP analyzed/VBD a/DT sample/NN of/IN 2,400/CD tax/NN returns/NNS filed/VBN between/IN 1980/CD and/CC 1984/CD ,/, expecting/VBG to/TO find/VB that/IN taxpayers/NNS who/WP opened/VBD IRAs/NNS during/IN 1982-84/CD gradually/RB reduced/VBD their/PP$ reported/JJ interest/NN and/CC dividend/NN income/NN as/IN they/PP shuffled/VBD assets/NNS out/IN of/IN taxable/JJ accounts/NNS and/CC into/IN IRAs/NN ./. 
To/TO our/PP$ surprise/NN ,/, we/PP found/VBD the/DT opposite/NN ./. 
Taxpayers/NNS who/WP purchased/VBD IRAs/NNS during/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT years/NNS 1982-84/CD tended/VBD to/TO increase/VB their/PP$ taxable/JJ saving/NN by/IN far/RB more/JJR than/IN those/DT who/WP did/VBD not/RB purchase/VB IRAs/NNS ./. 
We/PP were/VBD still/RB concerned/VBN that/IN shuffling/VBG may/MD be/VB taking/VBG place/NN at/IN a/DT more/RBR sophisticated/JJ level/NN ./. 
Suppose/VB that/IN thrifty/JJ households/NNS shuffle/VBP the/DT first/JJ $/$ 4,000/CD of/IN savings/NNS into/IN IRAs/NNS ,/, and/CC deposit/VBP the/DT rest/NN into/IN taxable/JJ money/NN market/NN accounts/NNS ,/, while/IN profligate/JJ households/NNS neither/CC save/VBP nor/CC open/VBP an/DT IRA/NN ./. 
Comparing/VBG a/DT thrifty/JJ household/NN with/IN a/DT profligate/JJ household/NN ,/, one/PP might/MD find/VB a/DT positive/JJ relationship/NN between/IN IRAs/NNS and/CC saving/VBG ,/, and/CC mistakenly/RB conclude/VB that/IN shuffling/VBG had/VBD n't/RB occurred/VBN ./. 
We/PP corrected/VBD for/IN this/DT by/IN comparing/VBG taxpayers/NNS with/IN the/DT same/JJ initial/JJ wealth/NN --/: which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ proxy/NN for/IN thriftiness/NN --/: and/CC our/PP$ results/NNS still/RB held/VBN ./. 
One/CD puzzling/JJ question/NN remains/VBZ :/: Why/WRB should/MD IRA/NP enrollees/NNS go/VB on/IN savings/NNS binges/NNS ?/. 
Perhaps/RB IRA/NP advertisements/NNS during/IN the/DT 1980s/NNS encouraged/VBD all/DT types/NNS of/IN retirement/NN saving/NN ./. 
Supporting/VBG evidence/NN for/IN this/DT view/NN comes/VBZ from/IN our/PP$ finding/NN that/IN one-third/NN of/IN all/DT IRA/NP enrollees/NNS contributed/VBD exactly/RB $/$ 2,000/CD ,/, when/WRB in/IN fact/NN they/PP were/VBD eligible/JJ to/TO contribute/VB up/IN to/TO $/$ 4,000/CD ./. 
Why/WRB $/$ 2,000/CD ?/. 
Advertising/NN may/MD have/VB conveyed/VBN both/DT correct/JJ information/NN about/IN the/DT high/JJ rate/NN of/IN return/NN on/IN IRAs/NNS ,/, and/CC incorrect/JJ information/NN that/IN the/DT legal/JJ limit/NN was/VBD $/$ 2,000/CD ./. 
One/CD strong/JJ predictor/NN of/IN IRA/NP enrollment/NN was/VBD whether/IN the/DT taxpayer/NN owed/VBD money/NN to/TO the/DT IRS/NP on/IN April/NP 14/CD ./. 
We/PP interpret/VBP this/DT to/TO mean/VB that/IN a/DT taxpayer/NN in/IN a/DT 40/CD %/NN bracket/NN preferred/VBD to/TO open/VB a/DT $/$ 2,000/CD saving/NN account/NN rather/RB than/IN write/VB an/DT $/$ 800/CD check/NN to/TO the/DT IRS/NP ./. 
The/DT instant/NN gratification/NN of/IN deducting/VBG IRA/NP contributions/NNS both/DT increases/VBZ the/DT popularity/NN of/IN the/DT program/NN ,/, and/CC overcomes/VBZ any/DT shortsighted/JJ bias/NN for/IN consumption/NN over/IN saving/NN ./. 
The/DT recent/JJ Merrill-Lynch/NP proposal/NN ,/, which/WDT provides/VBZ future/JJ tax/NN breaks/NNS but/CC no/DT current/JJ tax/NN deduction/NN ,/, lacks/VBZ this/DT appealing/JJ feature/NN ./. 
Even/RB the/DT prospect/NN of/IN higher/JJR tax/NN rates/NNS during/IN retirement/NN (/( when/WRB the/DT principal/NN plus/CC interest/NN is/VBZ finally/RB taxed/VBN )/) may/MD do/VB little/JJ to/TO damp/VB the/DT joy/NN of/IN denying/VBG the/DT IRS/NP its/PP$ due/NN ./. 
The/DT revenue/NN cost/NN of/IN IRAs/NNS looms/VBZ large/JJ in/IN political/JJ debates/NNS ./. 
It/PP should/MD be/VB remembered/VBN ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN the/DT tax/NN deducted/VBN from/IN the/DT IRA/NP contribution/NN is/VBZ deferred/VBN ,/, and/CC not/RB lost/VBN forever/RB ./. 
Of/IN course/NN ,/, future/JJ tax/NN revenue/NN may/MD hold/VB little/JJ appeal/NN to/TO politicians/NNS concerned/JJ with/IN Gramm-Rudman/NP ,/, but/CC the/DT future/JJ tax/NN payments/NNS represent/VBP a/DT valuable/JJ source/NN of/IN future/JJ revenue/NN ./. 
The/DT $/$ 350/CD billion/CD in/IN IRA/NP wealth/NN represents/VBZ $/$ 70/CD billion/CD in/IN future/JJ tax/NN revenue/NN at/IN a/DT conservative/JJ 20/CD %/NN marginal/JJ tax/NN rate/NN ./. 
IRAs/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB viewed/VBN as/IN the/DT single/JJ cure/NN for/IN the/DT nation/NN 's/POS low/JJ saving/NN rate/NN ./. 
They/PP have/VBP never/RB accounted/VBN for/IN more/JJR than/IN 1/CD %/NN of/IN GNP/NP ,/, so/RB they/PP are/VBP unlikely/JJ by/IN themselves/PP to/TO bridge/VB the/DT savings/NNS gap/NN between/IN the/DT U.S./NP and/CC other/JJ countries/NNS ./. 
And/CC some/DT new/JJ IRA/NN proposals/NNS make/VBP it/PP easy/JJ to/TO withdraw/VB money/NN before/IN retirement/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD make/VB shuffling/VBG more/RBR tempting/JJ to/TO taxpayers/NNS ./. 
But/CC in/IN comparison/NN to/TO proposed/VBN capital/NN gains/NNS tax/NN reductions/NNS in/IN Congress/NP ,/, IRAs/NNS are/VBP both/DT more/RBR equitable/JJ and/CC direct/JJ in/IN encouraging/VBG domestic/JJ savings/NNS ./.

Since/IN April/NP ,/, several/JJ teams/NNS have/VBP been/VBN searching/VBG in/IN other/JJ cancers/NNS for/IN the/DT gene/NN ,/, known/VBN as/IN p53/NN ./.

The/DT researcher/NN ,/, John/NP Minna/NP ,/, has/VBZ yet/RB to/TO publish/VB the/DT findings/NNS ./.

''/'' AT&T/NP has/VBZ targeted/VBN certain/JJ countries/NNS for/IN expansion/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT openness/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN and/CC how/WRB AT&T/NP 's/POS technology/NN fits/VBZ into/IN that/DT market/NN ./.

The/DT biggest/JJS cost/NN of/IN refinancing/NN is/VBZ usually/RB the/DT bank/NN 's/POS up-front/JJ fee/NN ,/, or/CC ``/`` points/NNS ./. 
''/'' Each/DT point/NN is/VBZ equal/JJ to/TO 1/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN the/DT mortgage/NN ./.
