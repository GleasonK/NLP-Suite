Although/IN the/DT Spanish/JJ master/NN 's/POS great/JJ historical/JJ and/CC allegorical/JJ compositions/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN ``/`` Las/NP Meninas/NP ,/, ''/'' ``/`` The/NP Weavers/NPS ''/'' and/CC ``/`` The/NP Surrender/NP of/IN Breda/NP ,/, ''/'' could/MD not/RB be/VB lent/VBN by/IN the/DT Prado/NP Museum/NP in/IN Madrid/NP ,/, what/WP the/DT Prado/NP and/CC other/JJ museums/NNS have/VBP lent/VBN offers/VBZ us/PP a/DT rare/JJ and/CC wonderful/JJ overview/NN of/IN his/PP$ work/NN ./.

Indeed/RB its/PP$ loan/NN of/IN no/RB fewer/JJR than/IN 17/CD paintings/NNS to/TO this/DT show/NN is/VBZ a/DT unique/JJ ,/, even/RB a/DT grand/JJ gesture/NN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, this/DT show/NN of/IN 38/CD paintings/NNS is/VBZ a/DT marvelous/JJ and/CC exciting/JJ event/NN in/IN many/JJ ways/NNS ./. 
Diego/NP Rodriquez/NP de/IN Silva/NP y/NP Velazquez/NP ,/, who/WP was/VBD born/VBN in/IN Seville/NP in/IN 1599/CD and/CC died/VBD in/IN Madrid/NP in/IN 1660/CD ,/, was/VBD not/RB only/RB the/DT most/RBS outstanding/JJ Spanish/JJ artist/NN of/IN the/DT 17th/JJ century/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT very/RB greatest/JJS painters/NNS of/IN all/DT time/NN ./. 
And/CC since/IN the/DT socially/RB ambitious/JJ Velazquez/NP spent/VBD a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN time/NN and/CC energy/NN on/IN his/PP$ activities/NNS at/IN court/NN ,/, he/PP painted/VBD only/RB about/IN 100/CD pictures/NNS ./. 
The/DT Met/NP 's/POS relatively/RB small/JJ show/NN therefore/RB makes/VBZ available/JJ nearly/RB half/PDT his/PP$ life/NN 's/POS work/NN ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ useless/JJ to/TO regret/VB what/WP is/VBZ not/RB here/RB ,/, especially/RB since/IN the/DT modest/JJ size/NN of/IN the/DT show/NN in/IN no/DT way/NN restricts/VBZ its/PP$ ambition/NN and/CC is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN an/DT invitation/NN to/TO intense/JJ viewing/NN ./. 
The/DT installation/NN is/VBZ similarly/RB inviting/JJ ./. 
The/DT walls/NNS have/VBP been/VBN painted/VBN in/IN muted/VBN tones/NNS to/TO show/VB the/DT pictures/NNS to/TO good/JJ advantage/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT discreetly/RB placed/VBN descriptive/JJ panels/NNS are/VBP concisely/RB informative/JJ ./. 
The/DT paintings/NNS reaffirm/VBP in/IN the/DT most/RBS direct/JJ fashion/NN that/DT Velazquez/NP is/VBZ perhaps/RB the/DT greatest/JJS optical/JJ realist/NN in/IN Western/JJ art/NN ./. 
Right/RB from/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN his/PP$ career/NN what/WP he/PP could/MD describe/VB with/IN his/PP$ brush/NN was/VBD no/RB less/JJR than/IN amazing/JJ ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ readily/RB apparent/JJ in/IN ``/`` An/NP Old/NP Woman/NP Cooking/NP Eggs/NPS ,/, ''/'' done/VBN when/WRB the/DT artist/NN was/VBD not/RB yet/RB 20/CD years/NNS old/JJ ./. 
Here/RB ,/, as/IN in/IN the/DT slightly/RB later/JJ ``/`` Waterseller/NP of/IN Seville/NP ,/, ''/'' everything/NN is/VBZ rendered/VBN with/IN such/JJ sharp-focus/JJ clarity/NN that/IN you/PP almost/RB could/MD mistake/VB the/DT image/NN for/IN the/DT real/JJ thing/NN ./. 
But/CC even/RB in/IN these/DT meticulously/RB detailed/VBN early/JJ paintings/NNS ,/, everyday/JJ reality/NN also/RB is/VBZ invested/VBN with/IN something/NN more/RBR --/: a/DT sense/NN of/IN ritual/NN and/CC solemnity/NN that/WDT transcends/VBZ mere/JJ naturalism/NN ./. 
Indeed/RB ,/, this/DT show/NN demonstrates/VBZ that/IN for/IN all/PDT his/PP$ apparent/JJ matter-of-factness/NN ,/, Velazquez/NP remains/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS mysterious/JJ of/IN painters/NNS ,/, and/CC that/DT part/NN of/IN his/PP$ greatness/NN was/VBD his/PP$ uncanny/JJ ability/NN to/TO see/VB ,/, and/CC give/VB form/NN to/TO ,/, the/DT mystery/NN that/WDT lies/VBZ below/IN the/DT surface/NN of/IN things/NNS ./. 
From/IN 1623/CD on/IN ,/, shortly/RB after/IN he/PP settled/VBD in/IN Madrid/NP ,/, he/PP was/VBD royal/JJ painter/NN to/TO the/DT highly/RB cultivated/VBN King/NP Philip/NP IV/NP ,/, six/CD years/NNS his/PP$ junior/NN ,/, who/WP became/VBD something/NN of/IN a/DT friend/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN a/DT patron/NN ./. 
Velazquez/NP 's/POS work/NN from/IN that/DT time/NN forward/RB was/VBD confined/VBN largely/RB to/TO portraits/NNS of/IN the/DT royal/JJ family/NN and/CC members/NNS of/IN the/DT court/NN ./. 
But/CC what/WP he/PP did/VBD with/IN this/DT fairly/RB limited/VBN range/NN of/IN subject/JJ matter/NN is/VBZ quite/RB astonishing/JJ ./. 
He/PP did/VBD not/RB confine/VB himself/PP to/TO the/DT upper/JJ reaches/NNS of/IN court/NN society/NN but/CC painted/VBD its/PP$ full/JJ spectrum/NN ,/, from/IN the/DT glorious/JJ and/CC the/DT glamorous/JJ to/TO the/DT grotesque/JJ ./. 
Outstanding/JJ in/IN that/DT first/JJ category/NN are/VBP some/DT amazingly/RB accomplished/VBN renderings/NNS of/IN the/DT king/NN ,/, starting/VBG with/IN three/CD elegant/JJ full-length/NN royal/JJ portraits/NNS near/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT show/NN ,/, and/CC culminating/VBG with/IN a/DT small/JJ but/CC intensely/RB moving/VBG portrait/NN bust/NN of/IN the/DT aged/JJ and/CC world-weary/JJ monarch/NN at/IN the/DT very/JJ end/NN ./. 
Also/RB notable/JJ is/VBZ the/DT Prado/NP 's/POS large/JJ and/CC dazzlingly/RB virtuoso/JJ equestrian/JJ portrait/NN of/IN the/DT Count-Duke/NP of/IN Olivares/NP ,/, Velazquez/NP 's/POS first/JJ major/JJ patron/NN ,/, and/CC for/IN many/JJ years/NNS the/DT power/NN behind/IN the/DT throne/NN ./. 
The/DT rendering/NN of/IN Olivares/NP is/VBZ a/DT tour/FW de/FW force/FW of/IN bravura/JJ brushwork/NN ,/, but/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN the/DT picture/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN has/VBZ a/DT most/RBS impressive/JJ dignity/NN and/CC weight/NN ./. 
Velazquez/NP 's/POS double/JJ portrait/NN of/IN the/DT elegantly/RB dressed/VBN and/CC doll-like/JJ infant/NN prince/NN Baltasar/NP Carlos/NP with/IN a/DT wayward-looking/JJ young/JJ dwarf/NN is/VBZ a/DT moving/VBG study/NN in/IN contrasts/NNS of/IN inherited/VBN privilege/NN and/CC natural/JJ gifts/NNS ./. 
The/DT portraits/NNS of/IN the/DT haggard/JJ court/NN buffoon/NN called/VBN ``/`` Don/NP Juan/NP of/IN Austria/NP ''/'' and/CC of/IN the/DT freakish/JJ dwarf/NN called/VBN ``/`` El/NP Nino/NP de/FW Vallecas/NP ''/'' are/VBP tragic/JJ in/IN their/PP$ unflinching/JJ forthrightness/NN ,/, and/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN touching/VBG in/IN their/PP$ deep/JJ sense/NN of/IN human/JJ sympathy/NN ./. 
Even/RB Velazquez/NP 's/POS relatively/RB rare/JJ mythological/JJ paintings/NNS are/VBP as/RB unusual/JJ as/IN they/PP are/VBP accomplished/VBN ./. 
In/IN the/DT early/JJ ``/`` Forge/NP of/IN Vulcan/NP ,/, ''/'' a/DT positively/RB radiant/JJ Apollo/NP steps/VBZ into/IN a/DT rather/RB ordinary/JJ smithy/NN to/TO tell/VB the/DT blacksmith/NN of/IN the/DT gods/NNS about/IN his/PP$ wife/NN 's/POS infidelity/NN ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ an/DT incongruous/JJ scene/NN ,/, this/DT odd/JJ mixture/NN of/IN mythology/NN and/CC genre/NN ,/, but/CC nonetheless/RB it/PP holds/VBZ together/RB and/CC is/VBZ surprisingly/RB forceful/JJ ./.

In/IN all/DT of/IN these/DT paintings/NNS ,/, as/IN in/IN almost/RB everything/NN else/RB in/IN the/DT show/NN ,/, you/PP are/VBP constantly/RB aware/JJ of/IN the/DT artist/NN 's/POS extraordinarily/RB sharp/JJ capacity/NN for/IN visual/JJ observation/NN ,/, matched/VBN by/IN a/DT dispassionate/JJ but/CC equally/RB sharp/JJ sense/NN of/IN psychological/JJ insight/NN ./. 
No/DT one/CD before/IN or/CC since/IN was/VBD a/DT better/JJR ``/`` pure/JJ ''/'' painter/NN than/IN Velazquez/NP ./. 
Nor/CC has/VBZ any/DT other/JJ painter/NN better/RB captured/VBN on/IN canvas/NN the/DT subtleties/NNS of/IN light/NN and/CC atmosphere/NN ,/, the/DT elusiveness/NN of/IN passing/VBG time/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT illusiveness/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN of/IN painting/NN ./.

''/'' Mr./NP Horowitz/NP ,/, a/DT former/JJ general/JJ counsel/NN to/TO the/DT U.S./NP Office/NP of/IN Management/NP and/CC Budget/NP ,/, bailed/VBN out/IN late/JJ last/JJ month/NN ./. 
A/DT collapse/NN of/IN Myerson/NP &/CC Kuhn/NP ,/, should/MD it/PP occur/VB ,/, would/MD make/VB Mr./NP Myerson/NP a/DT two-time/JJ loser/NN ./. 
In/IN November/NP 1987/CD ,/, the/DT firm/NN where/WRB he/PP worked/VBD --/: Finley/NP ,/, Kumble/NP ,/, Wagner/NP ,/, Heine/NP ,/, Underberg/NP ,/, Manley/NP ,/, Myerson/NP &/CC Casey/NP --/: fell/VBD apart/RB and/CC slid/VBD into/IN bankruptcy/NN proceedings/NNS ,/, where/WRB it/PP remains/VBZ ./. 
Just/RB a/DT decade/NN ago/IN ,/, such/JJ debacles/NNS in/IN the/DT elite/NN bar/NN were/VBD virtually/RB unheard-of/JJ ./. 
But/CC in/IN the/DT 1980s/CD ,/, competition/NN among/IN law/NN firms/NNS intensified/VBN ./. 
Top/JJ firms/NNS that/IN never/RB before/IN had/VBD hired/VBN a/DT lawyer/NN from/IN another/DT firm/NN began/VBD raiding/VBG the/DT competition/NN for/IN skilled/JJ practitioners/NNS who/WP could/MD bring/VB high-paying/JJ clients/NNS with/IN them/PP ./. 
In/IN the/DT process/NN ,/, many/JJ law/NN partnerships/NNS came/VBD unglued/JJ and/CC firms/NNS such/JJ as/IN Finley/NP Kumble/NP and/CC Myerson/NP &/CC Kuhn/NP became/VBD forces/NNS ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ a/DT trend/NN that/IN Stephen/NP Gillers/NP ,/, professor/NN of/IN ethics/NNS at/IN New/NP York/NP University/NP 's/POS law/NN school/NN ,/, calls/VBZ ``/`` the/DT new/JJ disloyalty/NN ./.

The/DT current/JJ mess/NN at/IN Myerson/NP &/CC Kuhn/NP is/VBZ mostly/RB about/IN money/NN and/CC mistrust/NN ./. 
It/PP involves/VBZ allegations/NNS that/IN the/DT firm/NN overbilled/VBD at/IN least/JJS one/CD major/JJ client/NN ,/, that/IN Mr./NP Myerson/NP misled/VBD partners/NNS about/IN how/WRB many/JJ clients/NNS the/DT firm/NN actually/RB has/VBZ ,/, and/CC that/IN he/PP took/VBD more/RBR from/IN the/DT firm/NN 's/POS coffers/NNS than/IN he/PP deserved/VBD ./. 
In/IN turn/NN ,/, Mr./NP Myerson/NP has/VBZ accused/VBN his/PP$ accusers/NNS of/IN impatience/NN and/CC has/VBZ called/VBN some/DT of/IN them/PP ``/`` traitors/NNS ''/'' for/IN jumping/VBG ship/NN ./. 
He/PP confirms/VBZ ,/, in/IN a/DT lengthy/JJ interview/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT firm/NN is/VBZ suffering/VBG a/DT ``/`` cash/NN crunch/NN ''/'' but/CC says/VBZ it/PP is/VBZ n't/RB terminal/JJ ./.

Mr./NP Myerson/NP ,/, like/IN most/JJS of/IN his/PP$ partners/NNS ,/, broke/VBD into/IN the/DT legal/JJ big/JJ leagues/NNS in/IN a/DT very/RB different/JJ era/NN ./. 
The/DT son/NN of/IN a/DT Philadelphia/NP silk/NN and/CC woolens/NNS wholesaler/NN ,/, he/PP made/VBD his/PP$ name/NN as/IN a/DT trial/NN lawyer/NN in/IN the/DT 1970s/CD at/IN the/DT venerable/JJ New/NP York/NP firm/NN of/IN Webster/NP &/CC Sheffield/NP ,/, where/WRB he/PP rose/VBD to/TO co-managing/VBG partner/NN ./. 
The/DT firm/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, did/VBD n't/RB keep/VB pace/NN with/IN many/JJ of/IN its/PP$ more/JJR profit-oriented/JJ competitors/NNS ,/, so/IN Mr./NP Myerson/NP soon/RB found/VBD himself/PP earning/VBG less/RBR than/IN top/JJ litigators/NNS elsewhere/RB ./. 
Enter/VB the/DT go-getters/NNS at/IN Finley/NP Kumble/NP ,/, who/WP lured/VBD the/DT likes/NNS of/IN Mr./NP Myerson/NP with/IN fat/JJ contracts/NNS and/CC promises/NNS of/IN greater/JJR riches/NNS to/TO come/VB ./.

They/PP say/VBP Mr./NP Myerson/NP brimmed/VBD with/IN enthusiasm/NN about/IN his/PP$ project/NN and/CC made/VBD it/PP seem/VB like/IN an/DT exciting/JJ adventure/NN ./. 
He/PP offered/VBD potential/JJ partners/NNS a/DT chance/NN to/TO build/VB a/DT prestigious/JJ law/NN firm/NN and/CC have/VB a/DT hand/NN in/IN its/PP$ management/NN ./. 
Puffing/VBG deeply/RB on/IN fat/JJ cigars/NNS and/CC speaking/VBG confidently/RB in/IN a/DT raspy/NN ,/, excited/VBN voice/NN ,/, Mr./NP Myerson/NP seemed/VBD to/TO sweep/VB their/PP$ cares/NNS away/RB ./.

A/DT key/JJ part/NN of/IN Mr./NP Myerson/NP 's/POS sales/NNS pitch/NN was/VBD that/IN he/PP had/VBD assembled/VBN a/DT roster/NN of/IN blue-chip/JJ clients/NNS that/WDT included/VBD Mr./NP Trump/NP ,/, former/JJ Treasury/NP Secretary/NP William/NP Simon/NP and/CC Shearson/NP Lehman/NP ./.

Third-party/JJ maintenance/NN is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ portion/NN of/IN Control/NP Data/NP 's/POS overall/JJ computer/NN servicing/VBG business/NN ,/, which/WDT last/JJ year/NN posted/VBD sales/NNS of/IN about/RB $/$ 400/CD million/CD ./.

Each/DT had/VBD been/VBN in/IN the/DT private-placement/JJ department/NN of/IN Bear/NP ,/, Stearns/NP &/CC Co./NP with/IN the/DT same/JJ titles/NNS ./. 
James/NP Rill/NP 's/POS appointment/NN to/TO head/VB the/DT Department/NP of/IN Justice/NP 's/POS Antitrust/NP Division/NP has/VBZ met/VBN an/DT enthusiastic/JJ approval/NN that/IN other/JJ Bush/NP administration/NN nominees/NNS must/MD surely/RB envy/VB ./. 
From/IN all/DT points/NNS of/IN the/DT political/JJ compass/NN ,/, private/JJ practitioners/NNS ,/, legislators/NNS and/CC academics/NNS have/VBP welcomed/VBN Mr./NP Rill/NP 's/POS ascent/NN ./. 
The/DT current/JJ wisdom/NN is/VBZ that/DT Mr./NP Rill/NP will/MD arrest/VB the/DT rightward/JJ swing/NN in/IN federal/JJ antitrust/JJ activity/NN and/CC will/MD renew/VB enforcement/NN in/IN terrain/NN largely/RB abandoned/VBN by/IN the/DT Reagan/NP Antitrust/NP Division/NP and/CC Federal/NP Trade/NP Commission/NP ./. 
The/DT tone/NN and/CC content/NN of/IN Mr./NP Rill/NP 's/POS own/JJ statements/NNS since/IN joining/VBG the/DT Justice/NP Department/NP reliably/RB indicate/VBP that/IN the/DT center/NN of/IN gravity/NN of/IN federal/JJ enforcement/NN activity/NN is/VBZ about/IN to/TO move/VB to/TO the/DT left/NN ./. 
The/DT doubtful/JJ issue/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ not/RB the/DT direction/NN of/IN adjustment/NN but/CC its/PP$ degree/NN ./. 
Though/IN tougher/JJR speeches/NNS do/VBP foreshadow/VB some/DT noteworthy/JJ changes/NNS in/IN federal/JJ policy/NN ,/, Mr./NP Rill/NP will/MD probably/RB conserve/VB and/CC consolidate/VB the/DT core/NN elements/NNS of/IN the/DT Reagan/NP antitrust/JJ program/NN ./. 
The/DT Reagan/NP antitrust/JJ agencies/NNS adopted/VBD a/DT single-minded/JJ focus/NN upon/IN large/JJ horizontal/JJ mergers/NNS and/CC output-restricting/JJ agreements/NNS among/IN direct/JJ competitors/NNS ./. 
This/DT reorientation/NN entailed/VBD a/DT break/NN with/IN several/JJ past/JJ antitrust/JJ practices/NNS ./. 
First/RB ,/, the/DT Reagan/NP enforcement/NN agencies/NNS largely/RB removed/VBD the/DT government/NN from/IN the/DT business/NN of/IN scrutinizing/VBG exclusionary/JJ or/CC abusive/JJ conduct/NN by/IN dominant/JJ firms/NNS ./. 
From/IN 1981/CD through/IN 1988/CD ,/, the/DT Justice/NP Department/NP and/CC the/DT Federal/NP Trade/NP Commission/NP initiated/VBD three/CD cases/NNS enforcing/VBG the/DT Sherman/NP Act/NP 's/POS ban/NN on/IN monopolization/NN and/CC attempted/VBN monopolization/NN ./. 
This/DT level/NN of/IN federal/JJ enforcement/NN activity/NN was/VBD the/DT lowest/JJS in/IN any/DT eight-year/JJ period/NN since/IN 1900/CD ./. 
Second/NP ,/, the/DT Reagan/NP enforcement/NN agencies/NNS stopped/VBD enforcing/VBG rules/NNS that/WDT limited/VBD a/DT manufacturer/NN 's/POS choice/NN of/IN distribution/NN methods/NNS ./. 
So-called/JJ vertical/JJ distribution/NN restraints/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN resale/NN price/NN maintenance/NN ,/, had/VBD been/VBN a/DT recurring/VBG target/NN of/IN federal/JJ enforcement/NN in/IN the/DT post/NN World/NP War/NP II/NP era/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT Reagan/NP Justice/NP Department/NP filed/VBD no/DT vertical-restraint/JJ cases/NNS ./. 
Reagan/NP officials/NNS often/RB said/VBD they/PP would/MD prosecute/VB ``/`` economically/RB sound/JJ ''/'' vertical-restraints/NNS cases/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PP seldom/RB concealed/VBD their/PP$ belief/NN that/IN such/JJ matters/NNS were/VBD as/RB common/JJ as/IN unicorns/NNS ./. 
Third/JJ ,/, the/DT Reagan/NP antitrust/JJ agencies/NNS substantially/RB redirected/VBD public/JJ merger/NN enforcement/NN ./. 
The/DT administration/NN frequently/RB declined/VBD to/TO challenge/VB mergers/NNS that/WDT increased/VBD market/NN concentrations/NNS beyond/IN thresholds/NNS established/VBN in/IN its/PP$ own/JJ guidelines/NNS ./. 
Parties/NNS to/TO proposed/VBN transactions/NNS also/RB benefited/VBN from/IN extremely/RB favorable/JJ assumptions/NNS about/IN the/DT ability/NN of/IN new/JJ entrants/NNS or/CC existing/VBG fringe/NN firms/NNS to/TO defeat/VB any/DT effort/NN by/IN the/DT merged/VBN entity/NN to/TO reduce/VB output/NN and/CC raise/VB prices/NNS ./. 
Finally/RB ,/, the/DT focus/NN of/IN Reagan/NP non-merger/JJ enforcement/NN activity/NN shifted/VBD heavily/RB to/TO smaller/JJR firms/NNS ./. 
From/IN 1973/CD through/IN the/DT arrival/NN of/IN Reagan/NP appointees/NNS in/IN 1981/CD ,/, the/DT federal/JJ antitrust/JJ agencies/NNS brought/VBD a/DT total/NN of/IN 108/CD non-merger/JJ cases/NNS involving/VBG Fortune/NP 500/CD companies/NNS ./. 
From/IN 1981/CD through/IN 1988/CD ,/, that/DT number/NN fell/VBD to/TO 11/CD ./. 
This/DT trend/NN was/VBD particularly/RB evident/JJ in/IN the/DT federal/JJ government/NN 's/POS efforts/NNS to/TO prosecute/VB horizontal/JJ price-fixing/NN ,/, bid-rigging/NN and/CC market-allocation/JJ schemes/NNS ./. 
From/IN 1973-1981/CD to/TO 1981-1988/CD ,/, the/DT number/NN of/IN such/JJ cases/NNS involving/VBG Fortune/NP 500/CD firms/NNS dropped/VBD from/IN 47/CD to/TO 8/CD ./. 
Critics/NNS argue/VBP that/IN the/DT Reagan/NP administration/NN pursued/VBD an/DT aggressive/JJ campaign/NN to/TO collar/VB a/DT hapless/JJ ,/, economically/RB trivial/JJ parade/NN of/IN asphalt/JJ suppliers/NNS ,/, lawyers/NNS for/IN indigent/JJ criminal/JJ defendants/NNS ,/, moving/NN and/CC storage/NN firms/NNS ,/, bakeries/NNS ,/, individual/JJ physicians/NNS ,/, obscure/JJ trade/NN associations/NNS and/CC a/DT host/NN of/IN other/JJ commercial/JJ pygmies/NNS ./. 
The/DT Rill/NP Antitrust/NP Division/NP will/MD not/RB likely/RB depart/VB significantly/RB from/IN these/DT enforcement/NN approaches/NNS ./. 
The/DT most/RBS immediate/JJ and/CC fundamental/JJ constraint/NN upon/IN a/DT dramatic/JJ reinvigoration/NN of/IN forsaken/VBN antitrust/JJ approaches/NNS is/VBZ the/DT success/NN of/IN the/DT Reagan/NP reduction/NN of/IN the/DT government/NN 's/POS antitrust/JJ infrastructure/NN ./. 
Mr./NP Rill/NP and/CC FTC/NP Chairman/NP Janet/NP Steiger/NP have/VBP inherited/VBN organizations/NNS that/WDT are/VBP roughly/RB half/PDT their/PP$ size/NN of/IN 10/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./. 
Today/NN ,/, both/DT agencies/NNS have/VBP their/PP$ hands/NNS full/JJ keeping/VBG abreast/RB of/IN the/DT existing/VBG flow/NN of/IN merger/NN investigations/NNS and/CC horizontal-restraints/NNS matters/NNS ./. 
Current/JJ and/CC forseeable/JJ resource/NN limitations/NNS will/MD preclude/VB the/DT pursuit/NN of/IN more/JJR than/IN a/DT handful/NN of/IN new/JJ cases/NNS designed/VBN to/TO attack/VB dominant/JJ firm/JJ exclusionary/JJ conduct/NN or/CC vertical/JJ restraints/NNS ./. 
Even/RB if/IN Congress/NP were/VBD to/TO increase/VB antitrust/JJ expenditures/NNS ,/, the/DT Antitrust/NP Division/NP would/MD find/VB it/PP difficult/JJ to/TO recruit/VB and/CC retrain/VB talented/JJ attorneys/NNS to/TO pursue/VB an/DT expanded/VBN enforcement/NN agenda/NN ./. 
Joseph/NP Schumpeter/NP noted/VBD that/IN ``/`` A/DT good/JJ bureaucracy/NN is/VBZ a/DT slow/JJ growth/NN and/CC can/MD not/RB be/VB created/VBN at/IN will/NN ./. 
''/'' The/DT opportunity/NN costs/NNS for/IN bright/JJ law-school/JJ graduates/NNS considering/VBG a/DT job/NN with/IN a/DT federal/JJ agency/NN are/VBP staggering/JJ ./. 
The/DT entry-level/JJ Justice/NP Department/NP wage/NN of/IN about/RB $/$ 29,000/CD lags/VBZ roughly/RB $/$ 40,000/CD to/TO $/$ 50,000/CD behind/IN the/DT going/VBG rate/NN at/IN major/JJ law/NN firms/NNS in/IN Washington/NP or/CC New/NP York/NP ./. 
Even/RB with/IN promises/NNS of/IN a/DT role/NN in/IN a/DT ``/`` rejuvenated/VBN ''/'' antitrust/JJ program/NN ,/, Mr./NP Rill/NP faces/VBZ a/DT daunting/VBG task/NN in/IN getting/VBG the/DT upper/JJ strata/NNS of/IN the/DT talent/NN pool/NN to/TO join/VB ,/, and/CC remain/VB with/IN ,/, the/DT Antitrust/NP Division/NP ./. 
Indeed/RB ,/, Mr./NP Rill/NP 's/POS biggest/JJS challenge/NN will/MD be/VB to/TO reverse/VB an/DT erosion/NN of/IN human/JJ capital/NN that/IN ,/, unless/IN impeded/VBN ,/, will/MD turn/VB the/DT division/NN into/IN a/DT second/JJ -/: or/CC third-rate/JJ law/NN office/NN ./. 
A/DT second/JJ reason/NN to/TO expect/VB general/JJ consistency/NN between/IN Reagan/NP and/CC Bush/NP enforcement/NN policy/NN is/VBZ Mr./NP Rill/NP 's/POS awareness/NN of/IN modern/JJ antitrust/JJ enforcement/NN history/NN ./. 
Despite/IN calls/NNS for/IN more/RBR aggressive/JJ enforcement/NN against/IN single-firm/JJ conduct/NN ,/, Mr./NP Rill/NP knows/VBZ that/IN the/DT government/NN fared/VBD poorly/RB in/IN the/DT 1970s/NNS when/WRB pursuing/VBG large-firm/JJ attempted/VBN monopolization/NN and/CC monopolization/NN cases/NNS ./. 
Not/RB only/RB have/VBP these/DT cases/NNS often/RB exceeded/VBN the/DT institutional/JJ capabilities/NNS of/IN the/DT enforcement/NN agencies/NNS ,/, but/CC federal/JJ judges/NNS have/VBP endorsed/VBN relatively/RB permissive/JJ standards/NNS governing/VBG large-firm/JJ pricing/VBG ,/, product/NN development/NN and/CC promotional/JJ behavior/NN ./. 
These/DT cases/NNS are/VBP high-risk/JJ ,/, resource-intensive/JJ ventures/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PP would/MD be/VB surprising/JJ for/IN the/DT Bush/NP Antitrust/NP Division/NP to/TO undertake/VB more/JJR than/IN a/DT few/JJ of/IN them/PP ./. 
Although/IN important/JJ personnel/NNS and/CC policy/NN considerations/NNS point/VBP away/RB from/IN substantial/JJ adjustments/NNS in/IN enforcement/NN policy/NN ,/, modest/JJ expansion/NN in/IN merger/NN enforcement/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ ./. 
Experience/NN with/IN the/DT government/NN 's/POS merger/NN guidelines/NNS during/IN the/DT Reagan/NP administration/NN resembled/VBD the/DT typical/JJ baseball/NN umpire/NN 's/POS interpretation/NN of/IN the/DT strike/NN zone/NN ./. 
The/DT Reagan/NP merger/NN guidelines/NNS established/VBD a/DT nominal/JJ strike/NN zone/NN that/WDT extended/VBD from/IN the/DT letters/NNS down/RB to/TO the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT knee/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT enforcement/NN agencies/NNS rarely/RB called/VBD strikes/NNS on/IN pitches/NNS above/IN the/DT belt/NN ./. 
The/DT Rill/NP Antitrust/NP Division/NP seems/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO revive/VB the/DT high/JJ strike/NN ./. 
Bush/NP antitrust/JJ officials/NNS may/MD not/RB attack/VB a/DT substantially/RB greater/JJR number/NN of/IN mergers/NNS than/IN the/DT Reagan/NP administration/NN ,/, but/CC their/PP$ choice/NN of/IN cases/NNS will/MD signal/VB an/DT intent/NN to/TO apply/VB a/DT tighter/JJR mesh/NN ./. 
The/DT Antitrust/NP Division/NP 's/POS treatment/NN of/IN Coors/NP 's/POS proposed/VBN acquisition/NN of/IN Stroh/NP Brewing/NP will/MD indicate/VB where/WRB Mr./NP Rill/NP plans/VBZ to/TO draw/VB the/DT line/NN ./. 
Like/IN the/DT Rill/NP appointment/NN at/IN the/DT Justice/NP Department/NP ,/, Richard/NP Schmalensee/NP 's/POS confirmation/NN as/IN a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS Council/NP of/IN Economic/NP Advisers/NP suggests/VBZ a/DT moderation/NN of/IN the/DT Reagan/NP antitrust/JJ program/NN ./. 
Though/IN sympathetic/JJ to/TO the/DT modern/JJ retrenchment/NN of/IN antitrust/JJ ,/, Mr./NP Schmalensee/NP has/VBZ cautioned/VBN that/IN some/DT concepts/NNS have/VBP been/VBN carried/VBN to/TO unsupportable/JJ extremes/NNS ./. 
Two/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, he/PP suggested/VBD that/IN defendants/NNS in/IN merger/NN cases/NNS bear/VBP a/DT heavier/JJR burden/NN of/IN proof/NN when/WRB claiming/VBG ``/`` ease/NN of/IN entry/NN ''/'' in/IN an/DT industry/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO gain/VB approval/NN for/IN transactions/NNS in/IN concentrated/VBN markets/NNS ./. 
A/DT second/JJ area/NN destined/VBN for/IN some/DT expansion/NN is/VBZ vertical-restraints/NNS enforcement/NN ./. 
The/DT prosecution/NN of/IN an/DT occasional/JJ vertical-restraints/NNS case/NN would/MD coincide/VB with/IN Mr./NP Rill/NP 's/POS pledges/NNS to/TO enforce/VB existing/VBG prohibitions/NNS against/IN distribution/NN practices/NNS such/JJ as/IN resale/NN price/NN maintenance/NN ./. 
Unlike/IN Reagan/NP antitrust/JJ officials/NNS ,/, Mr./NP Rill/NP 's/POS specifications/NNS for/IN an/DT acceptable/JJ case/NN will/MD generate/VB genuine/JJ enforcement/NN possibilities/NNS ./. 
Bringing/VBG an/DT occasional/JJ case/NN also/RB would/MD permit/VB the/DT federal/JJ agencies/NNS to/TO reassert/VB control/NN over/IN a/DT field/NN of/IN enforcement/NN that/WDT has/VBZ fallen/VBN by/IN default/NN to/TO increasingly/RB active/JJ state/NN attorneys/NNS general/JJ ./. 
Because/IN recent/JJ Supreme/NP Court/NP decisions/NNS have/VBP increased/VBN the/DT burden/NN that/IN plaintiffs/NNS must/MD bear/VB to/TO challenge/VB vertical/JJ restraints/NNS ,/, the/DT output/NN of/IN new/JJ federal/JJ cases/NNS probably/RB will/MD be/VB small/JJ ./. 
The/DT Antitrust/NP Division/NP 's/POS enforcement/NN net/NN also/RB may/MD begin/VB to/TO yield/VB a/DT greater/JJR number/NN of/IN large/JJ companies/NNS in/IN non-merger/JJ cases/NNS ./. 
For/IN several/JJ years/NNS ,/, the/DT Justice/NP Department/NP has/VBZ been/VBN examining/VBG the/DT conduct/NN of/IN major/JJ defense-industry/JJ firms/NNS ./. 
Attention/NN to/TO collective/JJ or/CC single-firm/JJ behavior/NN in/IN this/DT and/CC other/JJ procurement/NN markets/NNS could/MD ensnare/VB companies/NNS of/IN considerable/JJ size/NN ./.

Lotus/NN and/CC other/JJ big/JJ software/NN producers/NNS have/VBP a/DT lot/NN to/TO fear/VB from/IN Windows/NP '/POS success/NN :/: Several/JJ have/VBP plowed/VBN millions/NNS of/IN dollars/NNS into/IN writing/VBG programs/NNS for/IN OS\/2/NP ,/, not/RB for/IN Windows/NP ./.

Mr./NP Gates/NP insists/VBZ he/PP has/VBZ n't/RB pushed/VBD Windows/NP at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN OS\/2/NP ./. 
``/`` The/DT worst/JJS thing/NN you/PP can/MD say/VB about/IN us/PP ,/, ''/'' he/PP says/VBZ ,/, ``/`` is/VBZ that/IN we/PP were/VBD over-optimistic/JJ ''/'' about/IN how/WRB quickly/RB OS\/2/NP would/MD gain/VB adherents/NNS ./.

``/`` I/PP guarantee/VB you/PP OS\/2/NP will/MD be/VB a/DT success/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PP says/VBZ ./. 
The/DT vast/JJ majority/NN of/IN personal/JJ computer/NN users/NNS rely/VBP on/IN programs/NNS written/VBN in/IN MS-DOS/NP ,/, the/DT operating/NN system/NN for/IN International/NP Business/NP Machines/NP Corp./NP 's/POS original/JJ PC/NP family/NN ./. 
Developed/VBN by/IN Microsoft/NP ,/, MS-DOS/NP has/VBZ ushered/VBN millions/NNS of/IN people/NNS into/IN the/DT computer/NN age/NN ,/, but/CC today/NN it/PP is/VBZ increasingly/RB seen/VBN as/IN outmoded/JJ ./. 
MS-DOS/NP programs/NNS are/VBP generally/RB difficult/JJ to/TO learn/VB because/IN they/PP require/VBP users/NNS to/TO remember/VB strings/NNS of/IN numbers/NNS ,/, and/CC one/CD mistaken/VBN keystroke/NN can/MD stymie/VB a/DT user/NN for/IN hours/NNS ./. 
OS\/2/NP is/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO remedy/VB the/DT shortcomings/NNS of/IN MS-DOS/NP ,/, employing/VBG a/DT graphical/JJ interface/NN popularized/VBN by/IN Apple/NP Computer/NP Inc./NP OS\/2/NP allows/VBZ a/DT user/NN to/TO point/NN at/IN icons/NNS ,/, or/CC pictures/NNS ,/, with/IN a/DT pointing/VBG device/NN known/VBN as/IN a/DT mouse/NN and/CC to/TO select/VB different/JJ functions/NNS from/IN menus/NNS ./. 
It/PP also/RB requires/VBZ makers/NNS of/IN different/JJ software/NN applications/NNS to/TO adhere/VB to/TO a/DT single/JJ screen/NN appearance/NN so/RB that/IN users/NNS can/MD more/RBR easily/RB learn/VB new/JJ programs/NNS ./. 
With/IN a/DT powerful/JJ enough/RB computer/NN ,/, OS\/2/NP also/RB can/MD run/VB programs/NNS simultaneously/RB and/CC easily/RB exchange/NN information/NN between/IN them/PP ./. 
OS\/2/NP program/NN developers/NNS argue/VBP that/IN the/DT system/NN ought/MD to/TO be/VB marketed/VBN to/TO users/NNS of/IN the/DT most/RBS powerful/JJ personal/JJ computers/NNS ,/, based/VBN on/IN Intel/NP Corp./NP 's/POS 386/CD microprocessor/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT MS-DOS/NP with/IN Windows/NP is/VBZ only/RB suitable/JJ for/IN older/JJR machines/NNS ./. 
But/CC things/NNS are/VBP n't/RB working/VBG out/RP that/DT way/NN ./. 
Windows/NP does/VBZ n't/RB offer/VB the/DT multitasking/VBG capability/NN of/IN OS\/2/NP ,/, but/CC it/PP does/VBZ duplicate/VB its/PP$ easy-to-use/JJ graphical/JJ approach/NN ./. 
It/PP only/RB costs/VBZ $/$ 99/CD for/IN a/DT machine/NN based/VBN on/IN Intel/NP 's/POS older/JJR 80286/CD microprocessor/NN and/CC $/$ 195/CD for/IN one/CD based/VBN on/IN the/DT 80386/CD ./.

''/'' BankAmerica/NP has/VBZ no/DT plans/NNS to/TO stop/VB dating/VBG Windows/NP any/DT time/NN soon/RB ./. 
Mr./NP Birenbaum/NP thinks/VBZ the/DT bank/NN ultimately/RB will/MD embrace/VB OS\/2/NP ,/, but/CC not/RB until/IN 1991/CD or/CC 1992/CD ./.

``/`` We/PP think/VBP this/DT fall/NN Windows/NP is/VBZ attaining/VBG critical/JJ mass/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Michael/NP Keen/NP ,/, manager/NN of/IN internal/JJ PC/NP support/NN for/IN Tandem/NP Computers/NP Inc./NP ,/, which/WDT owns/VBZ 6,000/CD personal/JJ computers/NNS world-wide/JJ ./.

''/'' Just/RB how/WRB long/JJ that/IN will/MD be/VB is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO say/VB ./. 
When/WRB introduced/VBN by/IN Microsoft/NP in/IN 1987/CD ,/, OS\/2/NP was/VBD immediately/RB hailed/VBN as/IN the/DT logical/JJ successor/NN to/TO MS-DOS/NP ./.

``/`` It/PP 's/VBZ crystal/NN clear/JJ that/IN OS\/2/CD is/VBZ not/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT successor/NN to/TO MS-DOS/NP ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Jeff/NP Tartar/NP ,/, editor/NN of/IN Softletter/NP ,/, an/DT industry/NN newsletter/NN ./. 
To/TO date/NN ,/, Microsoft/NP has/VBZ sold/VBN only/RB a/DT few/JJ hundred/CD thousand/CD copies/NNS of/IN OS\/2/NP ,/, compared/VBN with/IN more/JJR than/IN 12/CD million/CD copies/NNS of/IN MS-DOS/NP in/IN 1989/CD alone/RB ./.

The/DT slow/JJ sales/NNS of/IN OS\/2/NP are/VBP worrying/VBG Lotus/NP and/CC other/JJ software/NN makers/NNS who/WP bet/VBP on/IN the/DT operating/NN system/NN 's/POS success/NN ./.

So/RB far/RB ,/, pretrial/JJ settlements/NNS have/VBP relieved/VBN judges/NNS of/IN the/DT burden/NN of/IN establishing/VBG case/NN law/NN on/IN indoor/JJ pollution/NN ./.

The/DT most/RBS alarming/JJ leak/NN involved/VBD a/DT mysterious/JJ group/NN of/IN software/NN pirates/NNS called/VBD the/DT New/NP Prometheus/NP League/NP ./. 
The/DT group/NN ,/, which/WDT surfaced/VBD in/IN early/JJ June/NP ,/, mailed/VBD floppy/JJ disks/NNS containing/VBG some/DT of/IN the/DT Macintosh/NP 's/POS secret/JJ software/NN code/NN to/TO an/DT undetermined/JJ number/NN of/IN people/NNS ,/, including/VBG a/DT computer-industry/NN analyst/NN on/IN Wall/NP Street/NP ./.

At/IN one/CD time/NN or/CC another/DT ,/, some/DT 11,000/CD outside/JJ developers/NNS are/VBP privvy/JJ to/TO various/JJ secrets/NNS about/IN products/NNS in/IN development/NN ./.

Apple/NP swears/VBZ the/DT developers/NNS to/TO silence/VB by/IN requiring/VBG them/PP to/TO sign/VB a/DT pledge/NN of/IN secrecy/NN ./.

More/RBR recently/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, Apple/NP has/VBZ stepped/VBN up/RP efforts/NNS to/TO enforce/VB secrecy/NN among/IN outside/JJ developers/NNS ./. 
Staff/NN detectives/NNS drop/VBP in/IN without/IN warning/VBG more/RBR frequently/RB to/TO check/VB for/IN security/NN violations/NNS ./. 
Apple/NP has/VBZ punished/VBN some/DT developers/NNS in/IN the/DT past/NN by/IN denying/VBG them/PP access/NN to/TO important/JJ technical/JJ data/NNS and/CC the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO get/VB new/JJ products/NNS before/IN they/PP hit/VBP the/DT market/NN ./. 
Apple/NP 's/POS anti-leak/JJ campaign/NN has/VBZ sparked/VBN some/DT concern/NN within/IN the/DT company/NN ./. 
Some/DT workers/NNS think/VBP the/DT effort/NN conjures/VBZ up/RP a/DT sense/NN of/IN working/VBG under/IN an/DT Orwellian/JJ Big/NP Brother/NP ,/, ironically/RB an/DT image/NN Apple/NP used/VBD in/IN a/DT famous/JJ 1984/CD television/NN commercial/JJ attacking/VBG rival/NN International/NP Business/NP Machines/NPS Corp/NP ./. 
``/`` People/NNS are/VBP working/VBG scared/JJ ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ one/CD worker/NN who/WP asks/VBZ not/RB to/TO be/VB named/VBN ./.

''/'' (/( The/DT Grossman/NP paper/NN ,/, it/PP should/MD be/VB noted/VBN ,/, deals/VBZ solely/RB with/IN alcohol/NN and/CC tobacco/NN ./. 
)/) Alcohol/NN and/CC tobacco/NN consumption/NN by/IN minors/NNS is/VBZ especially/RB worrisome/JJ because/IN habits/NNS formed/VBD early/RB are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO persist/VB ./.

Because/IN age/NN limits/NNS can/MD be/VB evaded/VBN ,/, Mr./NP Grossman/NP suggests/VBZ that/IN substantial/JJ health/NN benefits/NNS might/MD accrue/VB to/TO increases/NNS in/IN federal/JJ excise/NN taxes/NNS on/IN alcohol/NN and/CC cigarettes/NNS ./. 
But/CC there/EX are/VBP problems/NNS ./. 
The/DT government/NN has/VBZ raised/VBN the/DT tax/NN on/IN whiskey/NN and/CC similar/JJ drinks/NNS much/RB more/RBR than/IN the/DT tax/NN on/IN beer/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ often/RB minors/NNS '/POS drink/NN of/IN choice/NN ./. 
If/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN alcohol/NN in/IN beer/NN were/VBD taxed/VBN as/RB much/RB as/IN the/DT alcohol/NN in/IN liquor/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT beer/NN tax/NN were/VBD raised/VBN to/TO offset/VB the/DT inflation/NN since/IN 1951/CD ,/, the/DT beer/NN tax/NN would/MD be/VB at/IN least/JJS eight/CD times/NNS its/PP$ current/JJ level/NN ./. 
Such/JJ a/DT huge/JJ tax/NN increase/NN ,/, Mr./NP Grossman/NP recognizes/VBZ ,/, raises/VBZ the/DT threat/NN of/IN bootleg/JJ beer/NN ./. 
It/PP 's/VBZ also/RB doubtful/JJ that/IN politicians/NNS would/MD ever/RB approve/VB such/JJ a/DT huge/JJ beer-tax/JJ boost/NN ./. 
Beer/NN has/VBZ long/RB been/VBN known/VBN as/IN the/DT poor/JJ man/NN 's/POS drink/NN ,/, and/CC Congress/NP has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN much/RB more/RBR leery/JJ of/IN taxing/VBG it/PP than/IN taxing/VBG the/DT key/JJ ingredients/NNS of/IN martinis/NNS and/CC the/DT like/JJ ./. 
In/IN a/DT backhanded/JJ way/NN ,/, Milton/NP Friedman/NP raises/VBZ yet/RB another/DT objection/NN to/TO high/JJ excise/NN taxes/NNS ./. 
He/PP notes/VBZ that/IN the/DT current/JJ market/NN in/IN bootleg/JJ liquor/NN stems/NNS in/IN part/NN from/IN the/DT high/JJ federal/JJ excise/NN taxes/NNS ./. 
At/IN some/DT level/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, high/JJ prices/NNS could/MD encourage/VB alcohol/NN or/CC drug/NN addicts/NNS to/TO steal/VB to/TO finance/VB purchases/NNS ./. 
Mr./NP Grossman/NP cites/VBZ studies/NNS by/IN Gary/NP Becker/NP ,/, a/DT University/NP of/IN Chicago/NP student/NN of/IN the/DT economics/NNS of/IN crime/NN ./. 
Two/CD decades/NNS ago/RB ,/, Mr./NP Becker/NP showed/VBD that/IN the/DT optimal/JJ way/NN for/IN a/DT society/NN to/TO deter/VB offenses/NNS is/VBZ by/IN a/DT system/NN of/IN severe/JJ and/CC fairly/RB certain/JJ punishments/NNS ./. 
Mr./NP Grossman/NP suggests/VBZ that/DT society/NN might/MD want/VB to/TO combine/VB a/DT stronger/JJR enforcement/NN program/NN covering/VBG alcohol/NN and/CC cigarettes/NNS with/IN a/DT higher/JJR excise/JJ tax/NN ./. 
Despite/IN the/DT complications/NNS ,/, the/DT empirical/JJ evidence/NN that/IN Mr./NP Grossman/NP has/VBZ assembled/VBN is/VBZ impressive/JJ ./. 
He/PP cites/VBZ a/DT 1982/CD study/NN that/WDT examined/VBD variations/NNS in/IN death/NN rates/NNS from/IN cirrhosis/NN of/IN the/DT liver/NN ,/, a/DT standard/JJ measure/NN of/IN excessive/JJ alcohol/NN use/NN ,/, among/IN the/DT states/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN variations/NNS in/IN per-capita/JJ consumption/NN of/IN distilled/VBN spirits/NNS ./. 
The/DT study/NN found/VBD that/IN the/DT state/NN excise/JJ tax/NN has/VBZ a/DT negative/JJ and/CC statistically/RB significant/JJ effect/NN on/IN the/DT cirrhosis/NN death/NN rate/NN ./. 
Moreover/RB ,/, a/DT $/$ 1/CD increase/NN per/IN gallon/NN in/IN the/DT state/NN excise/JJ tax/NN lowers/VBZ the/DT death/NN rate/NN by/IN almost/RB the/DT same/JJ percentage/NN as/IN it/PP lowers/VBZ per-capita/JJ consumption/NN (/( 5.4/CD %/NN vs./FW 7.2/CD %/NN )/) ./. 
The/DT experience/NN with/IN cigarettes/NNS is/VBZ a/DT mixed/JJ bag/NN ./. 
The/DT efforts/NNS to/TO deter/VB minors/NNS from/IN smoking/VBG are/VBP less/RBR energetic/JJ than/IN those/DT on/IN alcohol/NN ,/, presumably/RB because/IN an/DT individual/NN who/WP limits/VBZ his/PP$ bad/JJ habits/NNS to/TO smoking/VBG is/VBZ n't/RB as/RB likely/JJ to/TO climb/VB into/IN a/DT car/NN and/CC kill/VB someone/NN on/IN the/DT highway/NN ./. 
Slowly/RB ,/, but/CC apparently/RB steadily/RB ,/, the/DT publicity/NN about/IN the/DT health/NN effects/NNS of/IN cigarettes/NNS seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB cutting/VBG per-capita/JJ consumption/NN ./. 
One/CD nice/JJ aspect/NN of/IN the/DT anti-cigarette/JJ campaign/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PP is/VBZ ,/, in/IN effect/NN ,/, largely/RB financed/VBN by/IN the/DT tobacco/NN industry/NN ./.

If/IN and/CC when/WRB drugs/NNS are/VBP legalized/VBN ,/, Mr./NP Friedman/NP would/MD like/VB to/TO launch/VB an/DT effective/JJ educational/JJ campaign/NN on/IN the/DT personal/JJ costs/NNS of/IN drug/NN use/NN --/: ``/`` not/RB necessarily/RB conducted/VBN ,/, I/PP might/MD add/VB ,/, by/IN government/NN ./.

Advertising/NN privileges/NNS gradually/RB have/VBP been/VBN taken/VBN away/RB from/IN the/DT tobacco/NN industry/NN ,/, once/RB among/IN the/DT biggest/JJS of/IN all/DT advertisers/NNS ./. 
Of/IN course/NN ,/, a/DT responsibility/NN for/IN educational/JJ ads/NNS could/MD be/VB part/NN of/IN the/DT deal/NN of/IN drug/NN legalization/NN ./. 
The/DT more/RBR you/PP think/VBP about/IN the/DT way/NN we/PP handle/VBP alcohol/NN and/CC tobacco/NN now/RB ,/, the/DT more/RBR you/PP realize/VBP that/IN we/PP do/VBP n't/RB do/VB it/PP very/RB well/RB ./.

Excerpts/NNS :/: What/WP in/IN your/PP$ opinion/NN is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO cure/VB the/DT ills/NNS of/IN the/DT Soviet/JJ economy/NN ,/, to/TO put/VB it/PP ``/`` on/IN new/JJ rails/NNS ''/'' ?/. 
You/PP can/MD not/RB address/VB the/DT apparent/JJ ills/NNS of/IN the/DT Soviet/JJ economy/NN without/IN first/RB introducing/VBG a/DT monetary/JJ standard/NN of/IN value/NN ./. 
I/PP believe/VBP the/DT first/JJ thing/NN your/PP$ government/NN should/MD do/VB is/VBZ define/VB your/PP$ monetary/JJ unit/NN of/IN account/NN ,/, the/DT ruble/NN ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN a/DT fixed/VBN weight/NN of/IN gold/NN ,/, and/CC make/VB it/PP convertible/JJ at/IN that/DT weight/NN to/TO Soviet/JJ citizens/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN to/TO the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN ./. 
A/DT gold-convertible/JJ ruble/NN is/VBZ a/DT most/RBS unusual/JJ proposal/NN ./. 
We/PP have/VBP heard/VBN convertibility/NN proposed/VBN as/IN an/DT eventual/JJ goal/NN but/CC not/RB as/IN a/DT first/JJ step/NN ./. 
Why/WRB do/VBP you/PP think/VB it/PP should/MD be/VB done/VBN first/RB ?/. 
Your/PP$ perestroika/FW reforms/NNS face/VBP many/JJ difficult/JJ adjustment/NN problems/NNS as/IN you/PP move/VBP toward/IN market-oriented/JJ socialism/NN ./. 
These/DT become/VBP impossible/JJ problems/NNS without/IN a/DT monetary/JJ standard/NN of/IN value/NN that/WDT is/VBZ recognized/VBN as/IN having/VBG predictable/JJ value/NN throughout/IN the/DT Soviet/NP Union/NP --/: and/CC the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN --/: now/RB and/CC in/IN the/DT future/NN ./. 
Having/VBG such/JJ a/DT standard/NN for/IN your/PP$ money/NN would/MD ease/VB the/DT difficulties/NNS of/IN all/DT your/PP$ adjustment/NN problems/NNS ./. 
Do/VB you/PP mean/VBP perestroika/FW can/MD not/RB succeed/VB without/IN a/DT gold-convertible/JJ ruble/NN ?/. 
Some/DT believe/VBP it/PP might/MD succeed/VB with/IN a/DT mark/NN -/: ,/, yen/NN -/: or/CC dollar-convertible/JJ ruble/NN ,/, but/CC they/PP realize/VBP it/PP would/MD take/VB many/JJ years/NNS for/IN the/DT Gosbank/NP to/TO obtain/VB central-bank/JJ powers/NNS and/CC credibility/NN to/TO enable/VB the/DT ruble/NN to/TO trade/VB as/IN a/DT hard/JJ currency/NN ./. 
Yes/RB ,/, it/PP is/VBZ my/PP$ belief/NN that/IN without/IN an/DT honest/JJ money/NN ,/, Soviet/JJ citizens/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB expected/VBN to/TO respond/VB to/TO the/DT reforms/NNS --/: as/IN they/PP do/VBP not/RB have/VB a/DT meaningful/JJ incentive/NN ./. 
A/DT gold-backed/JJ ruble/NN would/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN an/DT honest/JJ money/NN at/IN home/NN and/CC would/MD immediately/RB trade/VB as/IN a/DT convertible/JJ currency/NN internationally/RB ./. 
Indeed/RB ,/, I/PP have/VBP offered/VBN a/DT prediction/NN to/TO several/JJ officials/NNS of/IN the/DT Soviet/JJ government/NN that/IN on/IN the/DT present/JJ slow/JJ course/NN ,/, the/DT reforms/NNS run/VBP a/DT very/RB high/JJ risk/NN of/IN being/VBG set/VBN back/RB by/IN a/DT general/JJ collapse/NN of/IN confidence/NN in/IN the/DT ruble/NN --/: an/DT inflationary/JJ disintegration/NN ./. 
Why/WRB is/VBZ that/DT ?/. 
As/RB long/RB as/IN the/DT Soviet/JJ economy/NN was/VBD completely/RB controlled/VBN at/IN the/DT center/NN ,/, the/DT absence/NN of/IN a/DT real/JJ money/NN merely/RB caused/VBD a/DT gradual/JJ decline/NN in/IN efficiency/NN of/IN your/PP$ economy/NN relative/JJ to/TO the/DT Western/JJ market/NN economies/NNS ./. 
Now/RB that/IN you/PP have/VBP decided/VBD to/TO move/VB toward/IN growth/NN and/CC competitiveness/NN with/IN the/DT West/NP ,/, opening/VBG up/RP market/NN opportunities/NNS through/IN cooperatives/NNS and/CC other/JJ market-oriented/JJ initiatives/NNS ,/, your/PP$ system/NN has/VBZ been/VBN divided/VBN in/IN half/NN ./. 
One/CD still/RB relies/VBZ on/IN wage/NN and/CC price/NN controls/NNS and/CC a/DT state/NN budget/NN allocations/NNS system/NN in/IN rubles/NNS ;/: the/DT other/JJ unleashes/VBZ individual/JJ incentives/NNS and/CC is/VBZ dominated/VBN by/IN an/DT attempt/NN to/TO obtain/VB hard/JJ currencies/NNS ,/, especially/RB the/DT dollar/NN ./. 
How/WRB does/VBZ this/DT affect/VB the/DT confidence/NN of/IN the/DT ruble/NN ?/. 
The/DT two/CD systems/NNS compete/VBP and/CC the/DT market/NN system/NN every/DT day/NN wins/VBZ new/JJ followers/NNS because/IN it/PP is/VBZ more/RBR efficient/JJ ./. 
So/RB each/DT day/NN the/DT ruble/NN system/NN loses/VBZ a/DT fragment/NN of/IN its/PP$ utility/NN ./. 
The/DT Soviet/JJ government/NN ,/, meanwhile/RB ,/, further/RBR subsidizes/VBZ the/DT ruble/NN system/NN by/IN increasing/VBG the/DT budget/NN deficit/NN ./. 
The/DT budget/NN deficit/NN is/VBZ funded/VBN by/IN issuing/VBG more/JJR ruble/NN bank/NN notes/NNS and/CC accounts/NNS ./. 
Thus/RB ,/, even/RB as/IN demand/NN for/IN the/DT ruble/NN declines/VBZ ,/, the/DT supply/NN increases/VBZ ./. 
Where/WRB you/PP had/VBD been/VBN deteriorating/VBG at/IN an/DT arithmetic/NN pace/NN ,/, you/PP are/VBP on/IN the/DT verge/NN of/IN deteriorating/VBG a/DT geometric/JJ pace/NN ./. 
If/IN this/DT is/VBZ so/RB ,/, inflation/NN will/MD accelerate/VB ?/. 
Exactly/RB ./. 
I/PP have/VBP advised/VBN officials/NNS of/IN your/PP$ Gosbank/NP of/IN my/PP$ analysis/NN --/: that/IN unless/IN something/NN is/VBZ done/VBN quickly/RB ,/, the/DT Soviet/JJ economy/NN will/MD face/VB increasing/VBG difficulties/NNS ./. 
Why/WRB do/VBP you/PP say/VB a/DT gold/NN standard/NN for/IN the/DT U.S.S.R./NP is/VBZ called/VBN for/RP ?/. 
No/DT other/JJ country/NN is/VBZ now/RB on/IN such/JJ a/DT convertible/JJ standard/NN ./. 
The/DT Western/NP economies/NNS have/VBP at/IN least/JJS a/DT history/NN of/IN gold/JJ convertibility/NN which/WDT enabled/VBD their/PP$ currency/NN to/TO start/VB with/IN a/DT base/NN value/NN as/IN they/PP abandoned/VBD the/DT Bretton/NP Woods/NP system/NN in/IN 1971/CD ./. 
So/RB ,/, the/DT Soviet/JJ people/NNS can/MD gain/VB if/IN their/PP$ government/NN issues/VBZ an/DT understandable/JJ monetary/JJ unit/NN of/IN value/NN based/VBN on/IN gold/NN ./. 
Besides/IN ,/, your/PP$ State/NP Bank/NP does/VBZ not/RB have/VB the/DT power/NN or/CC authority/NN to/TO limit/VB the/DT growth/NN of/IN bank/NN notes/NNS or/CC ruble/NN accounts/NNS so/IN as/IN to/TO stabilize/VB the/DT ruble/NN 's/POS value/NN ./. 
Even/RB if/IN it/PP were/VBD to/TO get/VB that/DT authority/NN from/IN the/DT government/NN ,/, it/PP is/VBZ not/RB likely/JJ to/TO have/VB the/DT independence/NN to/TO use/VB it/PP ./. 
Why/WRB do/VBP you/PP ,/, a/DT central/JJ banker/NN in/IN a/DT country/NN that/WDT has/VBZ demonetized/VBN gold/JJ ,/, select/VB gold/NN in/IN advising/VBG the/DT U.S.S.R./NP ?/. 
For/IN one/CD thing/NN ,/, I/PP believe/VBP gold/NN and/CC other/JJ commodity-price/JJ signals/NNS have/VBP become/VBN much/RB more/RBR important/JJ to/TO U.S./NP policy/NN making/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, as/IN we/PP have/VBP experienced/VBN inflation/NN pains/NNS under/IN a/DT floating/VBG exchange-rate/JJ system/NN ./. 
Gold/NN ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, remains/VBZ the/DT most/RBS monetary/JJ of/IN all/DT commodities/NNS ,/, and/CC therefore/RB is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS single/JJ conveyor/NN of/IN information/NN as/IN to/TO the/DT appropriate/JJ scarcity/NN of/IN money/NN ./. 
Secondly/RB ,/, a/DT single/JJ commodity/NN with/IN the/DT universal/JJ monetary/JJ role/NN of/IN gold/NN is/VBZ much/RB more/RBR simple/JJ than/IN attempting/VBG to/TO explain/VB a/DT properly/RB weighted/VBN commodity/NN price/NN index/NN base/NN ./. 
Thirdly/RB ,/, the/DT U.S.S.R./NP has/VBZ vast/JJ gold/NN monetary/JJ reserves/NNS it/PP is/VBZ not/RB now/RB using/VBG effectively/RB ./. 
Your/PP$ government/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT largest/JJS holders/NNS of/IN gold/NN bullion/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD give/VB it/PP great/JJ power/NN to/TO establish/VB the/DT credibility/NN of/IN such/JJ a/DT policy/NN ./. 
Would/MD n't/RB you/PP fear/VB these/DT reserves/NNS would/MD be/VB stripped/VBN from/IN the/DT government/NN as/IN Soviet/JJ citizens/NNS sought/VBD to/TO convert/VB surplus/JJ rubles/NNS into/IN gold/NN ?/. 
That/DT depends/VBZ entirely/RB on/IN two/CD questions/NNS that/IN the/DT government/NN could/MD easily/RB answer/VB ./. 
The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ the/DT ruble\/gold/JJ exchange/NN rate/NN that/IN the/DT government/NN would/MD announce/VB it/PP would/MD accommodate/VB and/CC defend/VB with/IN its/PP$ resources/NNS ./. 
It/PP can/MD not/RB be/VB too/RB low/JJ or/CC reserves/NNS will/MD spill/VB out/RP ./. 
It/PP can/MD not/RB be/VB too/RB high/JJ or/CC it/PP will/MD force/VB additional/JJ inflation/NN on/IN the/DT society/NN ,/, robbing/VBG Soviet/JJ savers/NNS of/IN rubles/NNS of/IN the/DT rewards/NNS of/IN their/PP$ past/NN labors/NNS ./. 
The/DT second/JJ is/VBZ the/DT willingness/NN of/IN the/DT U.S.S.R./NP to/TO commit/VB itself/PP to/TO the/DT discipline/NN of/IN confining/VBG government/NN deficits/NNS to/TO the/DT level/NN limited/VBN by/IN the/DT gold/JJ payments/NNS of/IN principal/NN and/CC interest/NN required/VBN of/IN the/DT gold/JJ bonds/NNS ./. 
You/PP can/MD not/RB go/VB on/IN a/DT gold/NN standard/NN ,/, then/RB continue/VBP to/TO fund/VB unlimited/JJ budget/NN deficits/NNS with/IN State/NP Bank/NP money/NN creation/NN ./. 
Could/MD you/PP guarantee/VB that/IN by/IN introducing/VBG ruble/NN convertibility/NN Soviet/JJ gold/NN reserves/NNS would/MD not/RB flow/VB out/IN of/IN the/DT country/NN ?/. 
All/DT gold/NN reserves/NNS will/MD not/RB flow/VB out/IN of/IN the/DT country/NN or/CC flow/NN into/IN hoards/NNS held/VBN by/IN Soviet/JJ citizens/NNS provided/VBN that/IN the/DT State/NP Bank/NP not/RB accommodate/VB the/DT government/NN budget/NN deficit/NN ./. 
This/DT means/VBZ that/IN the/DT current/JJ domestic/JJ deficit/NN must/MD be/VB financed/VBN with/IN bonds/NNS ,/, which/WDT of/IN course/NN become/VBP readily/RB marketable/JJ in/IN Moscow/NP ,/, Leningrad/NP ,/, New/NP York/NP and/CC London/NP if/IN the/DT bonds/NNS carry/VBP the/DT promise/NN to/TO pay/VB principal/NN and/CC interest/NN in/IN gold/NN ./. 
Indeed/RB ,/, I/PP would/MD expect/VB the/DT Soviet/NP Union/NP could/MD step/VB to/TO the/DT front/NN of/IN the/DT line/NN in/IN seeking/VBG credit/NN at/IN the/DT lowest/JJS possible/JJ interest/NN rate/NN ./. 
I/PP would/MD bet/VB such/JJ bonds/NNS would/MD be/VB snapped/VBN up/RP around/IN 3/CD %/NN ,/, which/WDT would/MD be/VB the/DT lowest/JJS governmental/JJ interest/NN rate/NN on/IN earth/NN ,/, including/VBG Japan/NP 's/POS ./. 
As/IN markets/NNS gain/VBP experience/NN with/IN Soviet/JJ gold-backed/JJ bonds/NNS ,/, interest/NN on/IN the/DT bonds/NNS could/MD be/VB expected/VBN to/TO decline/VB ,/, perhaps/RB approaching/VBG 2/CD %/NN ,/, the/DT going/VBG rate/NN for/IN U.S./NP gold-mining-company/JJ gold/NN bonds/NNS ./. 
What/WP interest/NN rate/NN would/MD Soviet/JJ bonds/NNS need/VB if/IN the/DT Gosbank/NP had/VBD an/DT independent/JJ monetary/JJ power/NN similar/JJ to/TO the/DT Fed/NP ?/. 
The/DT exercise/NN of/IN such/JJ independent/JJ monetary/JJ power/NN would/MD require/VB years/NNS to/TO gain/VB credibility/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, Soviet/JJ bonds/NNS would/MD require/VB an/DT inflation-offsetting/JJ premium/NN and/CC an/DT uncertainty/NN premium/NN of/IN perhaps/RB 4/CD %/NN to/TO 6/CD %/NN over/IN that/DT of/IN gold/JJ bonds/NNS ./. 
For/IN instance/NN ,/, if/IN Soviet/JJ inflation/NN is/VBZ currently/RB at/IN 10/CD %/NN ,/, then/RB the/DT expected/VBN interest/NN rate/NN would/MD be/VB initially/RB around/IN 18/CD %/NN ./. 
If/IN the/DT inflation/NN rate/NN is/VBZ higher/JJR ,/, then/RB it/PP would/MD take/VB proportionally/RB higher/JJR interest/NN rates/NNS to/TO stabilize/VB the/DT rate/NN of/IN inflation/NN ./. 
Other/JJ experts/NNS in/IN the/DT West/NN advise/VBP that/IN the/DT Soviet/NP Union/NP can/MD not/RB move/VB to/TO ruble/NN convertibility/NN without/IN more/JJR consumer/NN goods/NNS in/IN our/PP$ stores/NNS ,/, to/TO ``/`` mop/VB up/RP ''/'' the/DT surplus/NN ruble/NN overhang/NN ./. 
Does/VBZ this/DT not/RB concern/VB you/PP ?/. 
My/PP$ point/NN is/VBZ that/DT in/IN a/DT modern/NN industrial/JJ economy/NN ,/, consumer/NN goods/NNS will/MD not/RB be/VB produced/VBN unless/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT predictable/JJ monetary/JJ value/NN reward/NN ./. 
Once/RB the/DT government/NN of/IN the/DT U.S.S.R./NP announces/VBZ that/IN it/PP will/MD maintain/VB the/DT ruble/NN 's/POS gold/NN value/NN with/IN its/PP$ considerable/JJ resources/NNS ,/, demand/NN for/IN the/DT ruble/NN will/MD climb/VB ./. 
Soviet/JJ citizens/NNS and/CC others/NNS around/IN the/DT world/NN will/MD want/VB to/TO acquire/VB rubles/NNS --/: not/RB get/VB rid/JJ of/IN them/PP ./. 
The/DT only/JJ way/NN to/TO acquire/VB rubles/NNS is/VBZ to/TO work/VB to/TO get/VB them/PP or/CC ,/, as/IN foreigners/NNS ,/, exchange/VBP foreign/JJ work/NN income/NN for/IN them/PP in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN foreign/JJ exchange/NN ./. 
Undoubtedly/RB over/IN time/NN there/EX would/MD be/VB a/DT reserve/NN currency/NN demand/NN for/IN the/DT gold/NN ruble/NN ,/, particularly/RB among/IN countries/NNS with/IN close/JJ economic/JJ and/CC political/JJ ties/NNS to/TO the/DT How/WRB soon/RB do/VBP you/PP think/VB it/PP would/MD be/VB before/IN we/PP would/MD see/VB palpable/JJ benefits/NNS from/IN your/PP$ plan/NN ?/. 
My/PP$ guess/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT simple/NN announcement/NN would/MD generate/VB instant/JJ enthusiasm/NN ,/, a/DT feeling/NN of/IN well-being/NN ,/, among/IN the/DT citizens/NNS of/IN the/DT U.S.S.R./NP Street/NP speculation/NN would/MD disappear/VB overnight/RB and/CC the/DT so-called/JJ ruble/NN overhang/NN would/MD be/VB willingly/RB held/VBN in/IN deposits/NNS by/IN Soviet/JJ citizens/NNS ./. 
This/DT sounds/VBZ very/RB optimistic/JJ ./. 
Would/MD this/DT be/VB all/DT you/PP think/VBP is/VBZ required/VBN to/TO assure/VB the/DT success/NN of/IN perestroika/FW ?/. 
Not/RB at/IN all/DT ./. 
There/EX are/VBP important/JJ ,/, critical/JJ questions/NNS of/IN implementing/VBG market-oriented/JJ reforms/NNS leading/VBG to/TO the/DT role/NN of/IN prices/NNS in/IN allocating/VBG resources/NNS ,/, and/CC of/IN tax/NN policies/NNS that/WDT will/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB set/VBN right/RB as/RB well/RB ./. 
But/CC I/PP advise/VBP that/IN your/PP$ government/NN establish/VB a/DT monetary/JJ standard/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN you/PP will/MD be/VB less/RBR likely/JJ to/TO make/VB unnecessary/JJ and/CC costly/JJ errors/NNS on/IN these/DT other/JJ important/JJ decisions/NNS ./. 
Peter/NP Ueberroth/NP 's/POS bid/NN for/IN financially/RB ailing/VBG HAL/NP Inc./NP will/MD be/VB extended/VBN until/IN Oct./NP 10/CD ./.

If/IN every/DT data/NNS vendor/NN could/MD assign/VB Dun/NP 's/POS numbers/NNS to/TO its/PP$ files/NNS ,/, direct/JJ marketers/NNS could/MD easily/RB weed/VB out/RP duplicate/JJ names/NNS from/IN mailing/VBG lists/NNS bought/VBN from/IN different/JJ vendors/NNS ,/, avoiding/VBG the/DT expense/NN of/IN duplicate/JJ mailings/NNS ./.
