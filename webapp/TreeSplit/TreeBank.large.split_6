''/'' The/DT wording/NN of/IN the/DT final/JJ point/NN almost/RB compels/VBZ U.S./NP support/NN and/CC puts/VBZ the/DT Bush/NP administration/NN in/IN a/DT ticklish/JJ spot/NN ./.

On/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN it/PP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ what/WP Mr./NP Shamir/NP has/VBZ long/RB wanted/VBN :/: direct/JJ negotiations/NNS with/IN the/DT Palestinians/NPS without/IN pressure/NN from/IN an/DT array/NN of/IN hostile/JJ parties/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT Soviet/NP Union/NP and/CC China/NP ,/, who/WP would/MD have/VB been/VBN present/JJ at/IN any/DT international/JJ peace/NN conference/NN ./.

Dear/NP Milton/NP :/: There/EX was/VBD little/JJ ,/, if/IN anything/NN ,/, new/JJ in/IN your/PP$ open/JJ letter/NN to/TO me/PP calling/VBG for/IN the/DT legalization/NN of/IN drugs/NNS (/( The/DT Wall/NP Street/NP Journal/NP ,/, Sept./NP 7/CD )/) ./. 
As/IN the/DT excerpt/NN from/IN your/PP$ 1972/CD article/NN made/VBD clear/JJ ,/, the/DT legalization/NN argument/NN is/VBZ an/DT old/JJ and/CC familiar/JJ one/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ recently/RB been/VBN revived/VBN by/IN a/DT small/JJ number/NN of/IN journalists/NNS and/CC academics/NNS who/WP insist/VBP that/IN the/DT only/JJ solution/NN to/TO the/DT drug/NN problem/NN is/VBZ no/DT solution/NN at/IN all/DT ./. 
What/WP surprises/VBZ me/PP is/VBZ that/IN you/PP would/MD continue/VB to/TO advocate/VB so/RB unrealistic/JJ a/DT proposal/NN without/IN pausing/VBG to/TO consider/VB seriously/RB its/PP$ consequences/NNS ./. 
If/IN the/DT argument/NN for/IN drug/NN legalization/NN has/VBZ one/CD virtue/NN it/PP is/VBZ its/PP$ sheer/JJ simplicity/NN ./. 
Eliminate/VB laws/NNS against/IN drugs/NNS ,/, and/CC street/NN crime/NN will/MD disappear/VB ./. 
Take/VB the/DT profit/NN out/IN of/IN the/DT black/JJ market/NN through/IN decriminalization/NN and/CC regulation/NN ,/, and/CC poor/JJ neighborhoods/NNS will/MD no/RB longer/RB be/VB victimized/VBN by/IN drug/NN dealers/NNS ./. 
Cut/VB back/RB on/IN drug/NN enforcement/NN ,/, and/CC use/VB the/DT money/NN to/TO wage/VB a/DT public/JJ health/NN campaign/NN against/IN drugs/NNS ,/, as/IN we/PP do/VBP with/IN tobacco/NN and/CC alcohol/NN ./. 
The/DT basic/JJ premise/NN of/IN all/PDT these/DT propositions/NNS is/VBZ that/IN using/VBG our/PP$ nation/NN 's/POS laws/NNS to/TO fight/VB drugs/NNS is/VBZ too/RB costly/JJ ./. 
To/TO be/VB sure/JJ ,/, our/PP$ attempts/NNS to/TO reduce/VB drug/NN use/NN do/VBP carry/VB with/IN them/PP enormous/JJ costs/NNS ./. 
But/CC the/DT question/NN that/WDT must/MD be/VB asked/VBN --/: and/CC which/WDT is/VBZ totally/RB ignored/VBN by/IN the/DT legalization/NN advocates/NNS --/: is/VBZ ,/, what/WP are/VBP the/DT costs/NNS of/IN not/RB enforcing/VBG laws/NNS against/IN drugs/NNS ?/. 
In/IN my/PP$ judgment/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN the/DT judgment/NN of/IN virtually/RB every/DT serious/JJ scholar/NN in/IN this/DT field/NN ,/, the/DT potential/JJ costs/NNS of/IN legalizing/VBG drugs/NNS would/MD be/VB so/RB large/JJ as/IN to/TO make/VB it/PP a/DT public/JJ policy/NN disaster/NN ./. 
Of/IN course/NN ,/, no/DT one/NN ,/, including/VBG you/PP ,/, can/MD say/VB with/IN certainty/NN what/WP would/MD happen/VB in/IN the/DT U.S./NP if/IN drugs/NNS were/VBD suddenly/RB to/TO become/VB a/DT readily/RB purchased/VBN product/NN ./. 
We/PP do/VBP know/VB ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN wherever/WRB drugs/NNS have/VBP been/VBN cheaper/JJR and/CC more/RBR easily/RB obtained/VBN ,/, drug/NN use/NN --/: and/CC addiction/NN --/: has/VBZ skyrocketed/VBN ./. 
In/IN opium/NN and/CC cocaine/NN producing/VBG countries/NNS ,/, addiction/NN is/VBZ rampant/JJ among/IN the/DT peasants/NNS involved/VBN in/IN drug/NN production/NN ./. 
Professor/NP James/NP Q./NP Wilson/NP tells/VBZ us/PP that/IN during/IN the/DT years/NNS in/IN which/WDT heroin/NN could/MD be/VB legally/RB prescribed/VBN by/IN doctors/NNS in/IN Britain/NP ,/, the/DT number/NN of/IN addicts/NNS increased/VBN forty-fold/JJ ./. 
And/CC after/IN the/DT repeal/NN of/IN Prohibition/NP --/: an/DT analogy/NN favored/VBN but/CC misunderstood/VBN by/IN legalization/NN advocates/NNS --/: consumption/NN of/IN alcohol/NN soared/VBN by/IN 350/CD %/NN ./. 
Could/MD we/PP afford/VBP such/JJ dramatic/JJ increases/NNS in/IN drug/NN use/NN ?/. 
I/PP doubt/VBP it/PP ./. 
Already/RB the/DT toll/NN of/IN drug/NN use/NN on/IN American/JJ society-measured/VBN in/IN lost/VBN productivity/NN ,/, in/IN rising/VBG health/NN insurance/NN costs/NNS ,/, in/IN hospitals/NNS flooded/VBN with/IN drug/NN overdose/NN emergencies/NNS ,/, in/IN drug/NN caused/VBN accidents/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN premature/JJ death/NN --/: is/VBZ surely/RB more/JJR than/IN we/PP would/MD like/VB to/TO bear/VB ./. 
You/PP seem/VBP to/TO believe/VB that/IN by/IN spending/VBG just/RB a/DT little/RB more/JJR money/NN on/IN treatment/NN and/CC rehabilitation/NN ,/, the/DT costs/NNS of/IN increased/VBN addiction/NN can/MD be/VB avoided/VBN ./. 
That/DT hope/NN betrays/VBZ a/DT basic/JJ misunderstanding/NN of/IN the/DT problems/NNS facing/VBG drug/NN treatment/NN ./. 
Most/JJS addicts/NNS do/VBP n't/RB suddenly/RB decide/VB to/TO get/VB help/NN ./. 
They/PP remain/VBP addicts/NNS either/CC because/IN treatment/NN is/VBZ n't/RB available/JJ or/CC because/IN they/PP do/VBP n't/RB seek/VB it/PP out/RP ./. 
The/DT National/NP Drug/NP Control/NP Strategy/NP announced/VBD by/IN President/NP Bush/NP on/IN Sept./NP 5/CD goes/VBZ a/DT long/JJ way/NN in/IN making/VBG sure/JJ that/IN more/JJR treatment/NN slots/NNS are/VBP available/JJ ./. 
But/CC the/DT simple/JJ fact/NN remains/VBZ that/IN many/JJ drug/NN users/NNS wo/MD n't/RB enter/VB treatment/NN until/IN they/PP are/VBP forced/VBN to/TO --/: often/RB by/IN the/DT very/RB criminal/JJ justice/NN system/NN you/PP think/VBP is/VBZ the/DT source/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN ./. 
As/IN for/IN the/DT connection/NN between/IN drugs/NNS and/CC crime/NN ,/, your/PP$ unswerving/JJ commitment/NN to/TO a/DT legalization/NN solution/NN prevents/VBZ you/PP from/IN appreciating/VBG the/DT complexity/NN of/IN the/DT drug/NN market/NN ./. 
Contrary/JJ to/TO your/PP$ claim/NN ,/, most/JJS addicts/NNS do/VBP not/RB turn/VB to/TO crime/NN to/TO support/VB their/PP$ habit/NN ./. 
Research/NN shows/VBZ that/IN many/JJ of/IN them/PP were/VBD involved/VBN in/IN criminal/JJ activity/NN before/IN they/PP turned/VBD to/TO drugs/NNS ./. 
Many/JJ former/JJ addicts/NNS who/WP have/VBP received/VBN treatment/NN continue/VBP to/TO commit/VB crimes/NNS during/IN their/PP$ recovery/NN ./. 
And/CC even/RB if/IN drugs/NNS were/VBD legal/JJ ,/, what/WP evidence/NN do/VBP you/PP have/VBP that/IN the/DT habitual/JJ drug/NN user/NN would/MD n't/RB continue/VB to/TO rob/VB and/CC steal/VB to/TO get/VB money/NN for/IN clothes/NNS ,/, food/NN or/CC shelter/NN ?/. 
Drug/NN addicts/NNS always/RB want/VBP more/JJR drugs/NNS than/IN they/PP can/MD afford/VB ,/, and/CC no/DT legalization/NN scheme/NN has/VBZ yet/RB come/VBN up/RP with/IN a/DT way/NN of/IN satisfying/VBG that/DT appetite/NN ./. 
The/DT National/NP Drug/NP Control/NP Strategy/NP emphasizes/VBZ the/DT importance/NN of/IN reclaiming/VBG the/DT streets/NNS and/CC neighborhoods/NNS where/WRB drugs/NNS have/VBP wrought/VBN havoc/NN because/RB ,/, I/PP admit/VBP ,/, the/DT price/NN of/IN having/VBG drug/NN laws/NNS is/VBZ having/VBG criminals/NNS who/WP will/MD try/VB to/TO subvert/VB them/PP ./. 
Your/PP$ proposal/NN might/MD conceivably/RB reduce/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN gang/NN -/: and/CC dealer-related/JJ crime/NN ,/, but/CC it/PP is/VBZ fanciful/JJ to/TO suggest/VB that/IN it/PP would/MD make/VB crime/NN vanish/VB ./. 
Unless/IN you/PP are/VBP willing/JJ to/TO distribute/VB drugs/NNS freely/RB and/CC widely/RB ,/, there/EX will/MD always/RB be/VB a/DT black/JJ market/NN to/TO undercut/VB the/DT regulated/VBN one/NN ./. 
And/CC as/IN for/IN the/DT potential/JJ addicts/NNS ,/, for/IN the/DT school/NN children/NNS and/CC for/IN the/DT pregnant/JJ mothers/NNS ,/, all/DT of/IN whom/WP would/MD find/VB drugs/NNS more/RBR accessible/JJ and/CC legally/RB condoned/VBN ,/, your/PP$ proposal/NN would/MD offer/VB nothing/NN at/IN all/DT ./. 
So/IN I/PP advocate/VBP a/DT larger/JJR criminal/JJ justice/NN system/NN to/TO take/VB drug/NN users/NNS off/IN the/DT streets/NNS and/CC deter/VB new/JJ users/NNS from/IN becoming/VBG more/RBR deeply/RB involved/JJ in/IN so/RB hazardous/JJ an/DT activity/NN ./. 
You/PP suggest/VBP that/IN such/JJ policies/NNS would/MD turn/VB the/DT country/NN ``/`` into/IN an/DT armed/VBN camp/NN ./. 
''/'' Try/VB telling/VBG that/IN to/TO the/DT public/JJ housing/NN tenants/NNS who/WP enthusiastically/RB support/VBP plans/NNS to/TO enhance/VB security/NN in/IN their/PP$ buildings/NNS ,/, or/CC to/TO the/DT residents/NNS who/WP applaud/VBP police/NNS when/WRB a/DT local/JJ crack/NN house/NN is/VBZ razed/VBN ./. 
They/PP recognize/VBP that/DT drug/NN use/NN is/VBZ a/DT threat/NN to/TO the/DT individual/JJ liberty/NN and/CC domestic/JJ tranquility/NN guaranteed/VBN by/IN the/DT Constitution/NP ./. 
I/PP remain/VBP an/DT ardent/JJ defender/NN of/IN our/PP$ nation/NN 's/POS laws/NNS against/IN illegal/JJ drug/NN use/NN and/CC our/PP$ attempts/NNS to/TO enforce/VB them/PP because/IN I/PP believe/VBP drug/NN use/NN is/VBZ wrong/JJ ./. 
A/DT true/JJ friend/NN of/IN freedom/NN understands/VBZ that/DT government/NN has/VBZ a/DT responsibility/NN to/TO craft/VB and/CC uphold/VB laws/NNS that/WDT help/VBP educate/VB citizens/NNS about/IN right/JJ and/CC wrong/JJ ./. 
That/IN ,/, at/IN any/DT rate/NN ,/, was/VBD the/DT Founders/NPS '/POS view/NN of/IN our/PP$ system/NN of/IN government/NN ./. 
Today/NN this/DT view/NN is/VBZ much/RB ridiculed/VBN by/IN liberal/JJ elites/NNS and/CC entirely/RB neglected/VBN by/IN you/PP ./. 
So/RB while/IN I/PP can/MD not/RB doubt/VB the/DT sincerity/NN of/IN your/PP$ opinion/NN on/IN drug/NN legalization/NN ,/, I/PP find/VBP it/PP difficult/JJ to/TO respect/VB ./. 
The/DT moral/JJ cost/NN of/IN legalizing/VBG drugs/NNS is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PP is/VBZ a/DT cost/NN that/WDT apparently/RB lies/VBZ outside/IN the/DT narrow/JJ scope/NN of/IN libertarian/JJ policy/NN prescriptions/NNS ./. 
I/PP do/VBP not/RB have/VB a/DT simple/JJ solution/NN to/TO the/DT drug/NN problem/NN ./. 
I/PP doubt/VBP that/IN one/CD exists/VBZ ./. 
But/CC I/PP am/VBP committed/VBN to/TO fighting/VBG the/DT problem/NN on/IN several/JJ fronts/NNS through/IN imaginative/JJ policies/NNS and/CC hard/JJ work/NN over/IN a/DT long/JJ period/NN of/IN time/NN ./. 
As/IN in/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, some/DT of/IN these/DT efforts/NNS will/MD work/VB and/CC some/DT wo/MD n't/RB ./. 
Your/PP$ response/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ to/TO surrender/VB and/CC see/VB what/WP happens/VBZ ./. 
To/TO my/PP$ mind/NN that/WDT is/VBZ irresponsible/JJ and/CC reckless/JJ public/JJ policy/NN ./. 
At/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB national/JJ intolerance/NN for/IN drug/NN use/NN is/VBZ rapidly/RB increasing/VBG ,/, the/DT legalization/NN argument/NN is/VBZ a/DT political/JJ anachronism/NN ./. 
Its/PP$ recent/JJ resurgence/NN is/VBZ ,/, I/PP trust/VBP ,/, only/RB a/DT temporary/JJ distraction/NN from/IN the/DT genuine/JJ debate/NN on/IN national/JJ drug/NN policy/NN ./. 
William/NP J./NP Bennett/NP Director/NP Office/NP of/IN National/NP Drug/NP Control/NP A/DT powerful/JJ corn/NN farmers/NNS group/NN and/CC an/DT agricultural/JJ science/NN organization/NN are/VBP moving/VBG to/TO call/VB for/IN stronger/JJR surveillance/NN of/IN the/DT nation/NN 's/POS food/NN supply/NN for/IN cancer-causing/JJ aflatoxin/NN ./. 
The/DT actions/NNS by/IN the/DT National/NP Corn/NP Growers/NPS Association/NP and/CC the/DT Council/NP for/IN Agricultural/NP Science/NP and/CC Technology/NP signal/VBP a/DT shift/NN in/IN the/DT farm/NN industry/NN 's/POS position/NN on/IN aflatoxin/NN ,/, and/CC it/PP is/VBZ significant/JJ that/IN they/PP come/VBP from/IN groups/NNS representing/VBG the/DT agriculture/NN industry/NN instead/RB of/IN consumer/NN activists/NNS ./. 
This/DT development/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO put/VB pressure/NN on/IN Congress/NP and/CC Farm/NP Belt/NP states/NNS to/TO adopt/VB measures/NNS to/TO keep/VB the/DT fungus-produced/JJ poison/NN ,/, which/WDT contaminated/VBD much/RB of/IN the/DT Midwest/JJ corn/NN crop/NN last/JJ year/NN ,/, out/IN of/IN food/NN for/IN humans/NNS and/CC livestock/NN ./. 
The/DT moves/NNS also/RB reflect/VBP a/DT growing/VBG feeling/NN in/IN the/DT scientific/JJ community/NN that/DT aflatoxin/NN might/MD cause/VB more/JJR health/NN problems/NNS in/IN the/DT U.S./NP than/IN previously/RB thought/VBN ./. 
Aflatoxin/NN ,/, a/DT potent/JJ carcinogen/NN in/IN laboratory/NN animals/NNS ,/, is/VBZ excreted/VBN by/IN a/DT fungus/NN that/WDT thrives/VBZ in/IN hot/JJ and/CC dry/JJ climates/NNS ./. 
Although/IN it/PP often/RB plagues/VBZ the/DT corn/NN and/CC peanut/NN industry/NN in/IN the/DT Southeast/NP ,/, and/CC has/VBZ been/VBN linked/VBN to/TO several/JJ deaths/NNS there/RB ,/, it/PP did/VBD n't/RB become/VB a/DT political/JJ issue/NN until/IN the/DT 1988/CD drought/NN sparked/VBD an/DT outbreak/NN in/IN the/DT two/CD biggest/JJS corn-producing/JJ states/NNS ,/, Iowa/NP and/CC Illinois/NP ,/, from/IN which/WDT flow/VBP much/RB of/IN the/DT crop/NN consumed/VBN here/RB and/CC abroad/RB ./. 
Several/JJ nations/NNS complained/VBD of/IN finding/VBG aflatoxin/NN in/IN U.S./NP corn/NN and/CC corn/NN byproducts/NNS ./. 
The/DT amount/NN of/IN aflatoxin/NN that/WDT seeped/VBD into/IN the/DT U.S./NP food/NN chain/NN is/VBZ n't/RB clear/JJ ,/, but/CC spot-checking/NN by/IN state/NN and/CC federal/JJ officials/NNS found/VBD unsafe/JJ levels/NNS in/IN milled/JJ corn/NN and/CC milk/NN ,/, and/CC smaller/JJR amounts/NNS in/IN popcorn/NN ,/, cereal/NN and/CC chips/NNS ./. 
Although/IN the/DT Food/NP and/CC Drug/NP Administration/NP prohibits/VBZ the/DT interstate/JJ transport/NN of/IN corn/NN with/IN more/JJR than/IN a/DT tiny/JJ amount/NN of/IN aflatoxin/NN ,/, federal/JJ and/CC state/NN regulators/NNS were/VBD ill-prepared/JJ for/IN the/DT outbreak/NN ./. 
The/DT National/NP Corn/NP Growers/NPS Association/NP is/VBZ widely/RB expected/VBN to/TO adopt/VB recommendations/NNS by/IN its/PP$ influential/JJ Iowa/NP chapter/NN that/IN the/DT U.S./NP Agriculture/NP Department/NP look/VB for/IN aflatoxin/NN during/IN its/PP$ monthly/JJ surveys/NNS of/IN crop/NN conditions/NNS and/CC that/IN Midwest/JJ states/NNS routinely/RB screen/VB food/NN and/CC milk/NN for/IN residues/NNS of/IN the/DT poison/NN ./. 
Last/JJ year/NN ,/, Iowa/NP authorities/NNS were/VBD hamstrung/JJ in/IN part/NN because/IN they/PP did/VBD n't/RB gauge/NN the/DT severity/NN of/IN the/DT outbreak/NN until/IN October/NP ,/, when/WRB the/DT corn/NN harvest/NN was/VBD nearly/RB complete/JJ and/CC some/DT of/IN the/DT crop/NN had/VBD already/RB been/VBN sold/VBN to/TO processors/NNS ./. 
The/DT corn/NN group/NN 's/POS recommendations/NNS are/VBP modest/JJ ./. 
It/PP does/VBZ n't/RB ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, call/VB for/IN the/DT mandatory/JJ inspection/NN of/IN corn/NN before/IN processing/VBG --/: something/NN that/WDT is/VBZ required/VBN of/IN the/DT peanut/NN industry/NN ./. 
Yet/RB even/RB these/DT measures/NNS are/VBP a/DT significant/JJ change/NN in/IN the/DT farm/NN industry/NN ./. 
Earlier/RB ,/, farm/NN and/CC government/NN officials/NNS had/VBD reasoned/VBN that/IN outbreaks/NNS of/IN aflatoxin/NN in/IN the/DT Midwest/NP Corn/NP Belt/NP were/VBD too/RB rare/JJ to/TO justify/VB tight/JJ regulation/NN ./. 
But/CC the/DT 1988/CD outbreak/NN was/VBD the/DT third/JJ in/IN twelve/CD years/NNS ./. 
``/`` We/PP have/VBP to/TO realize/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT potential/NN for/IN a/DT problem/NN in/IN the/DT Midwest/NP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Ron/NP Swanson/NP ,/, a/DT Galt/NP ,/, Iowa/NP ,/, farmer/NN who/WP headed/VBD the/DT task/NN force/NN ./.

Because/IN aflatoxin/NN is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO detect/VB even/RB under/IN the/DT best/JJS of/IN laboratory/NN conditions/NNS ,/, some/DT farmers/NNS whose/WP$ corn/NN had/VBD been/VBN rejected/VBN at/IN one/CD elevator/NN were/VBD able/JJ to/TO have/VB it/PP accepted/VBN at/IN another/DT ./.

One/CD is/VBZ to/TO offer/VB Guangdong/NP 's/POS governor/NN a/DT job/NN in/IN Beijing/NP that/WDT would/MD represent/VB a/DT promotion/NN but/CC would/MD at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN remove/VB him/PP from/IN a/DT position/NN in/IN which/WDT he/PP was/VBD ignoring/VBG central-planning/JJ directives/NNS ./. 
The/DT other/JJ is/VBZ to/TO step/VB up/RP a/DT drive/NN that/WDT is/VBZ aimed/VBN ostensibly/RB at/IN fighting/VBG graft/NN at/IN the/DT highest/JJS levels/NNS in/IN Guangdong/NP and/CC Hainan/NP but/CC that/WDT several/JJ sources/NNS say/VBP is/VBZ actually/RB geared/VBN to/TO removing/VBG cadres/NNS who/WP have/VBP opposed/VBN the/DT central/JJ government/NN 's/POS hard-line/JJ stance/NN on/IN political/JJ and/CC economic/JJ policy/NN ./. 
Last/JJ week/NN ,/, Beijing/NP dismissed/VBD Liang/NP Xiang/NP ,/, the/DT boldly/RB reformist/JJ governor/NN of/IN the/DT island/NN province/NN of/IN Hainan/NP ,/, supposedly/RB for/IN abusing/VBG his/PP$ office/NN for/IN personal/JJ gain/NN ./. 
But/CC the/DT 70-year-old/JJ Mr./NP Liang/NP was/VBD closely/RB associated/VBN with/IN ousted/VBN Communist/NP Party/NP chief/NN Zhao/NP Ziyang/NP ,/, who/WP named/VBD him/PP governor/NN of/IN Hainan/NP last/JJ year/NN ./.

More/RBR than/IN any/DT other/JJ provinces/NNS ,/, Guangdong/NP and/CC Hainan/NP have/VBP benefited/VBN from/IN the/DT decentralization/NN policy/NN carried/VBN out/RP by/IN Mr./NP Zhao/NP ,/, who/WP lost/VBD his/PP$ job/NN in/IN June/NP after/IN refusing/VBG to/TO use/VB force/NN against/IN pro-democracy/JJ demonstrators/NNS in/IN Tiananmen/NP Square/NP ./. 
Several/JJ provinces/NNS have/VBP been/VBN allowed/VBN to/TO retain/VB a/DT bigger/JJR share/NN of/IN profit/NN tax/NN instead/RB of/IN handing/VBG over/RP most/JJS of/IN their/PP$ income/NN to/TO the/DT central/JJ government/NN ./. 
Profit/NN distribution/NN between/IN these/DT provinces/NNS and/CC Beijing/NP has/VBZ long/RB been/VBN a/DT source/NN of/IN conflict/NN and/CC is/VBZ especially/RB so/RB now/RB because/IN the/DT central/JJ government/NN is/VBZ strapped/VBN for/IN cash/NN ./. 
These/DT provinces/NNS also/RB have/VBP been/VBN allowed/VBN to/TO raise/VB funds/NNS in/IN Hong/NP Kong/NP and/CC elsewhere/RB ,/, with/IN Hainan/NP and/CC Guangdong/NP taking/VBG the/DT most/JJS advantage/NN of/IN this/DT ./. 
Instead/RB of/IN relying/VBG on/IN allocations/NNS from/IN Beijing/NP ,/, the/DT two/CD provinces/NNS have/VBP generated/VBN their/PP$ own/JJ funds/NNS to/TO finance/VB development/NN and/CC increasingly/RB looked/VBD to/TO capitalist/NN Hong/NP Kong/NP ,/, not/RB Beijing/NP ,/, as/IN their/PP$ beacon/NN of/IN development/NN ./. 
Such/JJ stirrings/NNS of/IN regionalism/JJ trouble/VBD Beijing/NP 's/POS hard-liners/NNS ,/, who/WP have/VBP consolidated/VBN power/NN after/IN the/DT democracy/NN movement/NN was/VBD suppressed/VBN in/IN June/NP ./.

Under/IN the/DT autonomous/JJ four-year/JJ rule/NN of/IN Mr./NP Ye/NP ,/, Guangdong/NP has/VBZ flourished/VBN by/IN ignoring/VBG central-planning/JJ directives/NNS ./.

Within/IN Guangdong/NP --/: and/CC in/IN contrast/NN to/TO Beijing/NP and/CC Shanghai/NP --/: the/DT governor/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN tolerance/NN and/CC restraint/NN toward/IN dissidents/NNS ./.
