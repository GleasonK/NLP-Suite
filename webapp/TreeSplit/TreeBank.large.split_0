Behind/IN all/DT the/DT hoopla/NN is/VBZ some/DT heavy-duty/JJ competition/NN ./. 
As/IN individual/JJ investors/NNS have/VBP turned/VBN away/RB from/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN over/IN the/DT years/NNS ,/, securities/NNS firms/NNS have/VBP scrambled/VBN to/TO find/VB new/JJ products/NNS that/WDT brokers/NNS find/VBP easy/JJ to/TO sell/VB ./.

History/NN ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, is/VBZ not/RB on/IN his/PP$ side/NN ./. 
According/VBG to/TO a/DT nationwide/JJ survey/NN taken/VBN a/DT year/NN ago/RB ,/, nearly/RB a/DT third/JJ of/IN England/NP 's/POS church/NN bells/NNS are/VBP no/RB longer/RBR rung/VBN on/IN Sundays/NNS because/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT one/CD to/TO ring/VB them/PP ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO see/VB why/WRB the/DT ancient/JJ art/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT ropes/NNS ./. 
The/DT less/RBR complicated/JJ version/NN of/IN playing/VBG tunes/NNS on/IN bells/NNS ,/, as/IN do/VB the/DT carillons/NNS of/IN continental/JJ Europe/NP ,/, is/VBZ considered/VBN by/IN the/DT English/NP to/TO be/VB childish/JJ ,/, fit/JJ only/RB for/IN foreigners/NNS ./. 
Change-ringing/NN ,/, a/DT mind-boggling/JJ exercise/NN the/DT English/NP invented/VBD 380/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, requires/VBZ physical/JJ dexterity/NN --some/DT bells/NNS weigh/VBP more/JJR than/IN a/DT ton/NN --combined/VBN with/IN intense/JJ mental/JJ concentration/NN ./. 
Proper/JJ English/JJ bells/NNS are/VBP started/VBN off/RP in/IN ``/`` rounds/NNS ,/, ''/'' from/IN the/DT highest-pitched/JJ bell/NN to/TO the/DT lowest/JJS --a/DT simple/JJ descending/VBG scale/NN using/VBG ,/, in/IN larger/JJR churches/NNS ,/, as/RB many/JJ as/IN 12/CD bells/NNS ./. 
Then/RB ,/, at/IN a/DT signal/NN ,/, the/DT ringers/NNS begin/VBP varying/VBG the/DT order/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT bells/NNS sound/VBP without/IN altering/VBG the/DT steady/JJ rhythm/NN of/IN the/DT striking/JJ ./. 
Each/DT variation/NN ,/, or/CC change/NN ,/, can/MD occur/VB only/RB once/RB ,/, the/DT rules/NNS state/VBP ./. 
Ringers/NNS memorize/VBP patterns/NNS of/IN changes/NNS ,/, known/VBN as/IN ``/`` methods/NNS ,/, ''/'' which/WDT have/VBP odd-sounding/JJ names/NNS like/IN Kent/NP Treble/NP Bob/NP Major/NP or/CC Grandsire/NP Caters/NP ./. 
A/DT series/NN of/IN 5,000/CD or/CC so/RB changes/NNS is/VBZ a/DT ``/`` peal/NN ''/'' and/CC takes/VBZ about/RB three/CD hours/NNS ./. 
A/DT look/NN at/IN a/DT Thursday/NP night/NN practice/NN at/IN St./NP Mary/NP Abbot/NP church/NN in/IN the/DT Kensington/NP district/NN of/IN London/NP gives/VBZ an/DT idea/NN of/IN the/DT work/NN involved/VBN ./. 
Ten/CD shirt-sleeved/JJ ringers/NNS stand/VBP in/IN a/DT circle/NN ,/, one/CD foot/NN ahead/RB of/IN the/DT other/JJ in/IN a/DT prize-fighter/NN 's/POS stance/NN ,/, each/DT pulling/VBG a/DT rope/NN that/WDT disappears/VBZ through/IN a/DT small/JJ hole/NN in/IN the/DT high/JJ ceiling/NN of/IN the/DT ringing/NN chamber/NN ./. 
No/DT one/PP speaks/VBZ ,/, and/CC the/DT snaking/VBG of/IN the/DT ropes/NNS seems/VBZ to/TO make/VB as/IN much/JJ sound/NN as/IN the/DT bells/NNS themselves/PP ,/, muffled/VBN by/IN the/DT ceiling/NN ./. 
Totally/RB absorbed/VBN ,/, the/DT ringers/NNS stare/VBP straight/RB ahead/RB ,/, using/VBG peripheral/JJ vision/NN (/( they/PP call/VBP it/PP ``/`` rope-sight/NN ''/'' )/) to/TO watch/VB the/DT other/JJ ropes/NNS and/CC thus/RB time/VB their/PP$ pulls/NNS ./.

This/DT does/VBZ not/RB sit/VB well/RB with/IN some/DT clerics/NNS ./. 
With/IN membership/NN of/IN the/DT Church/NP of/IN England/NP steadily/RB dwindling/VBG ,/, strong-willed/JJ vicars/NNS are/VBP pressing/VBG equally/RB strong-willed/JJ and/CC often/RB non-religious/JJ ringers/NNS to/TO attend/VB services/NNS ./.

At/IN St./NP Mary/NP 's/POS Church/NP in/IN Ilminster/NP ,/, Somerset/NP ,/, the/DT bells/NNS have/VBP fallen/VBN silent/JJ following/VBG a/DT dust-up/NN over/IN church/NN attendance/NN ./.

This/DT interpretation/NN was/VBD officially/RB endorsed/VBN by/IN Congress/NP in/IN 1987/CD in/IN the/DT Iran-Contra/NP Report/NP ./. 
As/IN partisans/NNS of/IN congressional/JJ power/NN understand/VBP ,/, a/DT ``/`` power/NN of/IN the/DT purse/NN ''/'' so/RB broadly/RB construed/VBN would/MD emasculate/VB the/DT presidency/NN and/CC swallow/VB the/DT principle/NN of/IN separation/NN of/IN powers/NNS ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ not/RB supported/VBN by/IN the/DT text/NN or/CC history/NN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NP ./. 
The/DT framers/NNS hardly/RB discussed/VBD the/DT appropriations/NNS clause/NN at/IN the/DT Constitutional/NP Convention/NP of/IN 1787/CD ,/, according/VBG to/TO Madison/NP 's/POS notes/NNS ./. 
To/TO the/DT extent/NN they/PP did/VBD ,/, their/PP$ concern/NN was/VBD to/TO ensure/VB fiscal/JJ accountability/NN ./.

It/PP would/MD contradict/VB that/DT objective/NN if/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS clause/NN (/( technically/RB a/DT limitation/NN on/IN legislative/JJ power/NN )/) could/MD be/VB read/VBN as/IN placing/VBG the/DT president/NN on/IN Congress/NP 's/POS short/JJ leash/NN ,/, making/VBG the/DT executive/NN consist/VBP of/IN the/DT president/NN and/CC every/DT member/NN of/IN Congress/NP ./. 
As/IN it/PP went/VBD to/TO the/DT conference/NN panel/NN now/RB deliberating/VBG ,/, the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/JJ office/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN for/IN fiscal/JJ 1990/CD contained/VBD some/DT breathtaking/JJ attempts/NNS by/IN Congress/NP to/TO rewrite/VB the/DT Constitution/NP under/IN the/DT pretext/NN of/IN protecting/VBG the/DT public/NN 's/POS money/NN ./. 
During/IN the/DT coming/VBG weeks/NNS ,/, President/NP Bush/NP must/MD decide/VB whether/IN to/TO veto/VB the/DT bills/NNS containing/VBG them/PP --/: or/CC ,/, alternatively/RB ,/, to/TO sign/VB these/DT bills/NNS into/IN law/NN with/IN a/DT statement/NN declaring/VBG their/PP$ intrusions/NNS on/IN executive/JJ power/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN violation/NN of/IN Article/NP II/NP ,/, and/CC thus/RB void/JJ and/CC severable/JJ ./. 
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NNS legislation/NN attempts/VBZ to/TO strip/VB the/DT president/NN of/IN his/PP$ powers/NNS to/TO make/VB certain/JJ appointments/NNS as/IN provided/VBN by/IN Article/NP II/NP ./. 
Article/NP II/NP places/VBZ on/IN the/DT president/NN the/DT duty/NN to/TO nominate/VB ,/, ``/`` and/CC by/IN and/CC with/IN the/DT Advice/NP and/CC Consent/NP of/IN the/DT Senate/NP ''/'' appoint/VB ,/, ambassadors/NNS ,/, judges/NNS ,/, and/CC other/JJ officers/NNS of/IN the/DT U.S/NP ./. 
It/PP also/RB empowers/VBZ the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recess/NN appointments/NNS ,/, without/IN Senate/NP approval/NN :/: ``/`` The/DT President/NP shall/MD have/VB Power/NN to/TO fill/VB up/IN all/DT Vacancies/NNS that/WDT may/MD happen/VB during/IN the/DT Recess/NN of/IN the/DT Senate/NP ,/, by/IN granting/VBG Commissions/NNS which/WDT shall/MD expire/VB at/IN the/DT End/NN of/IN their/PP$ next/JJ Session/NN ./. 
''/'' Yet/RB Section/NP 605/CD of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/JJ office/NN provides/VBZ :/: ``/`` No/DT part/NN of/IN any/DT appropriation/NN for/IN the/DT current/JJ fiscal/JJ year/NN contained/VBN in/IN this/DT or/CC any/DT other/JJ Act/NN shall/MD be/VB paid/VBN to/TO any/DT person/NN for/IN the/DT filling/NN of/IN any/DT position/NN for/IN which/WDT he/PP or/CC she/PP has/VBZ been/VBN nominated/VBN after/IN the/DT Senate/NP has/VBZ voted/VBN not/RB to/TO approve/VB the/DT nomination/NN of/IN said/VBN person/NN ./. 
''/'' Thus/RB ,/, with/IN one/CD brief/JJ passage/NN in/IN an/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN ,/, Congress/NP repeals/VBZ the/DT president/NN 's/POS power/NN to/TO make/VB recess/NN appointments/NNS under/IN Article/NP II/NP ./.

The/DT language/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS rider/NN implies/VBZ that/IN any/DT nomination/NN to/TO any/DT position/NN of/IN a/DT rejected/VBN nominee/NN will/MD result/VB in/IN the/DT president/NN being/VBG denied/VBN funding/VBG to/TO pay/VB that/DT person/NN 's/POS salary/NN ./. 
The/DT president/NN could/MD probably/RB not/RB avoid/VB this/DT restriction/NN by/IN choosing/VBG people/NNS willing/JJ to/TO serve/VB without/IN pay/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT Anti-Deficiency/NP Act/NP prohibits/VBZ voluntary/JJ service/NN to/TO the/DT government/NN ./. 
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NNS bills/NNS also/RB contain/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN ``/`` muzzling/JJ ''/'' provisions/NNS that/WDT violate/VBP the/DT recommendation/NN clause/NN in/IN Article/NP II/NP of/IN the/DT Constitution/NP ./.

Such/JJ laws/NNS violate/VBP the/DT provision/NN in/IN Article/NP II/NP that/WDT requires/VBZ the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recommendations/NNS to/TO Congress/NP ,/, but/CC which/WDT gives/VBZ the/DT president/NN the/DT discretion/NN to/TO select/VB the/DT subject/JJ matter/NN of/IN those/DT recommendations/NNS ./.

Probably/RB the/DT most/RBS egregious/JJ example/NN is/VBZ a/DT proviso/NN in/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/NN that/WDT prevents/VBZ the/DT president/NN 's/POS Office/NP of/IN Management/NP and/CC Budget/NP from/IN subjecting/VBG agricultural/JJ marketing/NN orders/NNS to/TO any/DT cost-benefit/JJ scrutiny/NN ./. 
There/EX is/VBZ something/NN inherently/RB suspect/JJ about/IN Congress/NP 's/POS prohibiting/VBG the/DT executive/NN from/IN even/RB studying/VBG whether/IN public/JJ funds/NNS are/VBP being/VBG wasted/VBN in/IN some/DT favored/VBN program/NN or/CC other/JJ ./. 
Perhaps/RB none/NN of/IN the/DT unconstitutional/JJ conditions/NNS contained/VBN in/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS bills/NNS for/IN fiscal/JJ 1990/CD better/RBR illustrates/VBZ Congress/NP 's/POS attempt/NN to/TO usurp/VB executive/JJ power/NN than/IN Section/NN 609/CD of/IN the/DT executive-office/NN bill/NN :/: ``/`` None/NN of/IN the/DT funds/NNS made/VBN available/JJ pursuant/JJ to/TO the/DT provisions/NNS of/IN this/DT Act/NN shall/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO implement/VB ,/, administer/VB ,/, or/CC enforce/VB any/DT regulation/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN disapproved/VBN pursuant/JJ to/TO a/DT resolution/NN of/IN disapproval/NN duly/RB adopted/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT applicable/JJ law/NN of/IN the/DT United/NP States/NPS ./.

The/DT Supreme/NP Court/NP 's/POS decision/NN in/IN INS/NP v./CC Chadha/NP held/VBD that/IN legislative/JJ vetoes/NNS are/VBP unconstitutional/JJ ./.

That/DT represents/VBZ a/DT very/RB thin/JJ ``/`` excess/JJ ''/'' return/NN ,/, certainly/RB far/RB less/JJR than/IN what/WP most/RBS fundamental/JJ stock/NN pickers/NNS claim/VBP to/TO seek/VB as/IN their/PP$ performance/NN objective/NN ./. 
The/DT fact/NN that/IN a/DT vast/JJ majority/NN of/IN fundamentalist/JJ money/NN managers/NNS fail/VBP to/TO beat/VB the/DT S&P/NP 500/CD may/MD contribute/VB to/TO the/DT hysteria/NN surrounding/VBG the/DT issue/NN ./.

So/RB if/IN index/NN arbitrage/NN is/VBZ simply/RB taking/VBG advantage/NN of/IN thin/JJ inefficiencies/NNS between/IN two/CD markets/NNS for/IN the/DT same/JJ widget/NN ,/, how/WRB did/VBD ``/`` program/NN trading/NN ''/'' evolve/VB into/IN the/DT evil/JJ creature/NN that/WDT is/VBZ evoking/VBG the/DT curses/NNS of/IN so/RB many/JJ observers/NNS ?/.

A/DT large/JJ investor/NN will/MD likely/RB cause/VB the/DT futures/NNS market/NN to/TO decline/VB when/WRB he/PP sells/VBZ his/PP$ futures/NNS ./. 
Arbitrage/NN simply/RB transfers/VBZ his/PP$ selling/NN pressure/NN from/IN Chicago/NP to/TO New/NP York/NP ,/, while/IN functioning/VBG as/IN a/DT buyer/NN in/IN Chicago/NP ./. 
The/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ process/NN is/VBZ the/DT key-someone/NN must/MD fundamentally/RB increase/VB or/CC decrease/VB his/PP$ ownership/NN in/IN widgets/NNS to/TO make/VB widget/NN prices/NNS move/VB ./. 
Why/WRB does/VBZ this/DT large/JJ hypothetical/JJ seller/NN trade/VB in/IN Chicago/NP instead/RB of/IN New/NP York/NP ?/.

If/IN not/RB Chicago/NP ,/, then/RB in/IN New/NP York/NP ;/: if/IN not/RB the/DT U.S./NP ,/, then/RB overseas/RB ./. 
Volatility/NN surrounding/VBG his/PP$ trades/NNS occurs/VBZ not/RB because/IN of/IN index/NN arbitrage/NN ,/, but/CC because/IN his/PP$ is/VBZ a/DT large/JJ addition/NN or/CC subtraction/NN to/TO a/DT widget/NN market/NN with/IN finite/JJ liquidity/NN ./. 
Eliminate/VB arbitrage/NN and/CC liquidity/NN will/MD decline/VB instead/RB of/IN rising/VBG ,/, creating/VBG more/JJR volatility/NN instead/RB of/IN less/JJR ./. 
The/DT speed/NN of/IN his/PP$ transaction/NN is/VBZ n't/RB to/TO be/VB feared/VBN either/RB ,/, because/IN faster/JJR and/CC cleaner/JJR execution/NN is/VBZ desirable/JJ ,/, not/RB loathsome/JJ ./.

''/'' Policies/NNS designed/VBN to/TO encourage/VB one/CD type/NN of/IN investor/NN over/IN another/DT are/VBP akin/JJ to/TO placing/VBG a/DT sign/NN over/IN the/DT Big/NP Board/NP 's/POS door/NN saying/VBG :/: ``/`` Buyers/NNS welcome/VB ,/, sellers/NNS please/VB go/VB away/RB /) ''/'' The/DT ultimate/JJ goal/NN of/IN any/DT investor/NN is/VBZ a/DT profit/NN motive/NN ,/, and/CC regulators/NNS should/MD not/RB concern/VB themselves/PP with/IN whether/IN investors/NNS are/VBP sufficiently/RB focused/VBN on/IN the/DT long/JJ term/NN ./. 
A/DT free/JJ market/NN with/IN a/DT profit/NN motive/NN will/MD attract/VB each/DT investor/NN to/TO the/DT liquidity/NN and/CC risks/NNS he/PP can/MD tolerate/VB ./. 
In/IN point/NN of/IN fact/NN ,/, volatility/NN as/IN measured/VBN by/IN the/DT annualized/JJ standard/JJ deviation/NN of/IN daily/JJ stock/NN price/NN movements/NNS has/VBZ frequently/RB been/VBN much/RB higher/JJR than/IN it/PP is/VBZ today/NN ./.

The/DT loudest/JJS of/IN these/DT reformers/NNS are/VBP money/NN managers/NNS who/WP cater/VBP to/TO smaller/JJR investors/NNS ./.

Jan/NP Leemans/NP ,/, research/NN director/NN ,/, said/VBD this/DT gene/NN was/VBD successfully/RB introduced/VBN in/IN oil-producing/JJ rapeseed/NN plants/NNS ,/, a/DT major/JJ crop/NN in/IN Europe/NP and/CC Canada/NP ,/, using/VBG as/IN a/DT carrier/NN a/DT ``/`` promoter/NN gene/NN ''/'' developed/VBN by/IN Robert/NP Goldberg/NP at/IN the/DT University/NP of/IN California/NP in/IN Los/NP Angeles/NP ./. 
The/DT sterilizing/VBG gene/NN is/VBZ expressed/VBN just/RB before/IN the/DT pollen/NN is/VBZ about/IN to/TO develop/VB and/CC it/PP deactivates/VBZ the/DT anthers/NNS of/IN every/DT flower/NN in/IN the/DT plant/NN ./. 
Mr./NP Leemans/NP said/VBD this/DT genetic/JJ manipulation/NN does/VBZ n't/RB hurt/VB the/DT growth/NN of/IN that/DT plant/NN ./. 
The/DT researchers/NNS also/RB pulled/VBD off/RP a/DT second/JJ genetic/JJ engineering/NN trick/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB male-sterile/JJ plants/NNS in/IN large/JJ enough/JJ numbers/NNS to/TO produce/VB a/DT commercial/JJ hybrid/JJ seed/NN crop/NN ./. 
They/PP attached/VBD a/DT second/JJ gene/NN ,/, for/IN herbicide/NN resistance/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT pollen-inhibiting/JJ gene/NN ./.

Mr./NP Leemans/NP said/VBD the/DT hybrid/NN rapeseeds/NNS created/VBN with/IN this/DT genetic/JJ engineering/NN yield/NN 15/CD %/NN to/TO 30/CD %/NN more/JJR output/NN than/IN the/DT commercial/JJ strains/NNS used/VBN currently/RB ./.

''/'' Ultimately/RB ,/, he/PP says/VBZ ,/, strong/JJ demand/NN could/MD help/VB to/TO drive/VB down/RP interest/NN rates/NNS on/IN mortgage/NN securities/NNS ./. 
At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, Nomura/NP is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ Japanese/JJ institution/NN authorized/VBN to/TO act/VB as/IN a/DT primary/JJ seller/NN of/IN Fannie/NP Mae/NP instruments/NNS ./.

These/DT securities/NNS are/VBP attractive/JJ to/TO Japanese/JJ investors/NNS for/IN three/CD reasons/NNS ./. 
First/LS ,/, they/PP are/VBP safe/JJ ./. 
While/IN they/PP are/VBP n't/RB backed/VBN by/IN the/DT full/JJ faith/NN and/CC credit/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NP government/NN ,/, as/IN Treasury/NP bonds/NNS are/VBP ,/, it/PP is/VBZ widely/RB assumed/VBN that/IN the/DT government/NN would/MD support/VB them/PP if/IN necessary/JJ ./. 
(/( U.S./NP Treasury/NP bonds/NNS are/VBP still/RB the/DT dollar-denominated/JJ investment/NN of/IN choice/NN for/IN long-term/JJ Japanese/JJ investors/NNS )/) ./. 
Second/LS ,/, they/PP are/VBP liquid/JJ ./. 
The/DT secondary/JJ market/NN in/IN federally/RB backed/JJ mortgage/NN securities/NNS now/RB exceeds/VBZ $/$ 900/CD billion/CD ,/, or/CC nearly/RB half/NN of/IN the/DT $/$ 2.2/CD trillion/CD in/IN U.S./NP residential/JJ mortgages/NNS issued/VBN ./. 
Third/LS ,/, they/PP offer/VBP high/JJ yields/NNS ./. 
At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, some/DT offer/VBP as/RB much/JJ as/IN 1.6/CD to/TO 1.8/CD percentage/NN points/NNS over/IN Treasury/NP securities/NNS of/IN similar/JJ maturities/NNS ./. 
But/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT risk/NN ,/, which/WDT the/DT Japanese/NPS discovered/VBD when/WRB they/PP first/RB dipped/VBD their/PP$ toes/NNS into/IN the/DT market/NN nearly/RB five/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./. 
Since/IN most/JJS mortgages/NNS can/MD be/VB prepaid/VBN or/CC refinanced/VBN at/IN any/DT time/NN ,/, issuers/NNS of/IN mortgage/NN securities/NNS retain/VBP the/DT right/NN to/TO buy/VB back/RB their/PP$ bonds/NNS before/IN maturity/NN ./. 
That/DT 's/VBZ a/DT headache/NN for/IN long-term/JJ investors/NNS ,/, since/IN it/PP forces/VBZ them/PP to/TO reinvest/VB their/PP$ money/NN --/: usually/RB at/IN lower/JJR rates/NNS than/IN the/DT original/JJ mortgage/NN securities/NNS carried/VBD ./. 
``/`` Two/CD or/CC three/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, the/DT problem/NN was/VBD that/IN people/NNS did/VBD n't/RB understand/VB the/DT prepayment/NN risk/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Nomura/NN 's/POS Mr./NP Kato/NP ./. 
``/`` So/RB they/PP were/VBD surprised/JJ and/CC very/RB disappointed/JJ by/IN prepayment/NN ./. 
''/'' Compounding/VBG the/DT trouble/NN to/TO Japanese/JJ investors/NNS ,/, mortgage/NN securities/NNS pay/VBP interest/NN monthly/RB ,/, since/IN most/JJS mortgages/NNS require/VBP homeowners/NNS to/TO make/VB monthly/JJ payments/NNS ./. 
But/CC Japanese/JJ institutional/JJ investors/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO quarterly/JJ or/CC semiannual/JJ payments/NNS on/IN their/PP$ investments/NNS ,/, so/IN the/DT monthly/JJ cash/NN flow/NN posed/VBD administrative/JJ problems/NNS ./. 
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, Japanese/JJ investors/NNS steered/VBD clear/RB of/IN the/DT mortgage/NN securities/NNS ./. 
But/CC they/PP did/VBD n't/RB lose/VB touch/NN with/IN the/DT U.S./NP issuers/NNS ./. 
Since/IN 1985/CD ,/, Japanese/JJ investors/NNS have/VBP bought/VBN nearly/RB 80/CD %/NN of/IN $/$ 10/CD billion/CD in/IN Fannie/NP Mae/NP corporate/JJ debt/NN issued/VBN to/TO foreigners/NNS ,/, money/NN that/IN Fannie/NP Mae/NP uses/VBZ to/TO buy/VB mortgages/NNS from/IN U.S./NP banks/NNS ./. 
And/CC Japanese/JJ investors/NNS took/VBD up/RB nearly/RB all/DT of/IN two/CD $/$ 200/CD million/CD Real/JJ Estate/NP Mortgage/NP Investment/NP Conduits/NNS ,/, a/DT kind/NN of/IN collateralized/JJ mortgage/NN obligation/NN ,/, that/WDT were/VBD offered/VBN to/TO foreigners/NNS this/DT year/NN ./. 
In/IN addition/NN ,/, further/JJ packaging/NN of/IN mortgage-backed/JJ securities/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN Blackstone/VBP 's/POS fund/NN ,/, have/VB reduced/VBN the/DT effects/NNS of/IN prepayment/NN risk/NN and/CC automatically/RB reinvest/VB monthly/JJ payments/NNS so/IN institutions/NNS do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO ./. 
Freddie/NP Mac/NP for/IN years/NNS has/VBZ offered/VBN a/DT so-called/JJ participation/NN certificate/NN that/WDT guarantees/VBZ it/PP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB prepaid/VBN for/IN a/DT set/NN number/NN of/IN years/NNS and/CC offers/VBZ semiannual/JJ payments/NNS ./. 
As/IN Georgia-Pacific/NP 's/POS bid/NN for/IN Great/NP Northern/NP Nekoosa/NP has/VBZ shown/VBN ,/, uninvited/JJ takeovers/NNS are/VBP still/RB alive/JJ despite/IN premature/JJ reports/NNS of/IN their/PP$ demise/NN ./. 
Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT debate/NN about/IN poison/NN pills/NNS will/MD continue/VB to/TO rage/VB in/IN the/DT boardrooms/NNS of/IN corporations/NNS and/CC the/DT halls/NNS of/IN academia/NN ./. 
Although/IN poison/NN pills/NNS come/VBP in/IN different/JJ colors/NNS and/CC shapes/NNS ,/, they/PP usually/RB give/VBP current/JJ shareholders/NNS the/DT right/NN to/TO buy/VB more/JJR stock/NN of/IN their/PP$ corporation/NN at/IN a/DT large/JJ discount/NN if/IN certain/JJ events/NNS occur/VBP --/: typically/RB ,/, if/IN a/DT hostile/JJ bidder/NN acquires/VBZ more/JJR than/IN a/DT specified/JJ percentage/NN of/IN the/DT corporation/NN 's/POS stock/NN ./. 
However/RB ,/, these/DT discount/NN purchase/NN rights/NNS may/MD generally/RB be/VB redeemed/VBN at/IN a/DT nominal/JJ cost/NN by/IN the/DT corporation/NN 's/POS directors/NNS if/IN they/PP approve/VBP of/IN a/DT bidder/NN ./. 
Supporters/NNS of/IN poison/NN pills/NNS argue/VBP that/DT their/PP$ adoption/NN forces/VBZ bidders/NNS to/TO negotiate/VB with/IN a/DT corporation/NN 's/POS directors/NNS ,/, who/WP are/VBP thereby/RB put/VBN in/IN a/DT better/JJR position/NN to/TO pursue/VB the/DT long-term/JJ interests/NNS of/IN the/DT corporation/NN ./. 
Recent/JJ studies/NNS by/IN Georgeson/NP &/CC Co./NP conclude/VBP that/IN corporations/NNS with/IN poison/NN pills/NNS have/VBP experienced/VBN greater/JJR stock-price/JJ appreciation/NN than/IN corporations/NNS without/IN poison/NN pills/NNS during/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./. 
Critics/NNS of/IN poison/NN pills/NNS argue/VBP that/IN they/PP harm/VBP shareholders/NNS by/IN letting/VBG corporate/JJ management/NN defeat/VB takeover/NN bids/NNS at/IN premium/JJ prices/NNS and/CC by/IN deterring/VBG premium/JJ bids/NNS from/IN ever/RB being/VBG made/VBN to/TO shareholders/NNS ./. 
These/DT critics/NNS are/VBP backed/VBN by/IN several/JJ academic/JJ studies/NNS showing/VBG that/IN the/DT adoption/NN of/IN poison/NN pills/NNS reduces/VBZ shareholder/NN values/NNS not/RB merely/RB in/IN the/DT short/JJ run/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB over/IN longer/JJR periods/NNS ./. 
Institutional/JJ investors/NNS that/WDT must/MD evaluate/VB poison/NN pills/NNS on/IN a/DT regular/JJ basis/NN are/VBP interested/JJ less/RBR in/IN this/DT general/JJ debate/NN than/IN in/IN the/DT answers/NNS to/TO specific/JJ questions/NNS about/IN the/DT corporation/NN issuing/VBG the/DT pill/NN ./. 
Does/VBZ this/DT corporation/NN have/VB a/DT high-quality/JJ management/NN team/NN with/IN a/DT good/JJ track/NN record/NN ?/. 
Does/VBZ this/DT team/NN have/VB a/DT viable/JJ strategy/NN for/IN improving/VBG shareholder/NN values/NNS ,/, and/CC does/VBZ this/DT strategy/NN require/VB implementation/NN over/IN an/DT extended/JJ period/NN ?/. 
Will/MD the/DT adoption/NN of/IN this/DT particular/JJ form/NN of/IN a/DT poison/NN pill/NN significantly/RB improve/VB the/DT chances/NNS for/IN management/NN to/TO carry/VB out/RP this/DT strategy/NN ?/. 
If/IN the/DT answers/NNS to/TO these/DT questions/NNS are/VBP affirmative/JJ ,/, then/RB institutional/JJ investors/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO be/VB favorably/RB disposed/JJ toward/IN a/DT specific/JJ poison/NN pill/NN ./. 
However/RB ,/, the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/DT once/RB most/JJS poison/JJ pills/NNS are/VBP adopted/VBN ,/, they/PP survive/VBP forever/RB ./. 
Although/IN the/DT current/JJ management/NN team/NN may/MD be/VB outstanding/JJ ,/, who/WP will/MD be/VB the/DT CEO/NP in/IN 10/CD years/NNS ?/. 
Although/IN the/DT five-year/JJ strategy/NN may/MD be/VB excellent/JJ ,/, what/WP will/MD be/VB the/DT strategy/NN in/IN 25/CD years/NNS ?/. 
The/DT solution/NN to/TO this/DT problem/NN is/VBZ a/DT time-limited/JJ poison/NN pill/NN ./. 
The/DT limit/NN could/MD range/VB from/IN three/CD years/NNS to/TO seven/CD years/NNS ,/, depending/VBG on/IN the/DT composition/NN of/IN the/DT management/NN team/NN and/CC the/DT nature/NN of/IN its/PP$ strategic/JJ plan/NN ./. 
At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT period/NN ,/, the/DT poison/NN pill/NN would/MD be/VB eliminated/VBN automatically/RB ,/, unless/IN a/DT new/JJ poison/NN pill/NN were/VBD approved/VBN by/IN the/DT then-current/JJ shareholders/NNS ,/, who/WP would/MD have/VB an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO evaluate/VB the/DT corporation/NN 's/POS strategy/NN and/CC management/NN team/NN at/IN that/DT time/NN ./. 
One/CD rare/JJ example/NN of/IN a/DT time-limited/JJ poison/NN pill/NN is/VBZ the/DT shareholder/NN rights/NNS plan/NN adopted/VBN by/IN Pennzoil/NP last/JJ year/NN after/IN it/PP received/VBD a/DT huge/JJ litigation/NN settlement/NN from/IN Texaco/NP ./. 
Pennzoil/NP 's/POS poison/NN pill/NN covers/VBZ five/CD years/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO give/VB current/JJ management/NN enough/JJ time/NN to/TO put/VB these/DT proceeds/NNS to/TO work/VB in/IN a/DT prudent/JJ manner/NN ./. 
Another/DT interesting/JJ example/NN is/VBZ the/DT poison/NN pill/NN adopted/VBN recently/RB by/IN Pittsburgh-based/JJ National/NP Intergroup/NP Inc./NP ,/, a/DT diversified/JJ holding/VBG company/NN ./. 
The/DT State/NP of/IN Wisconsin/NP Investment/NP Board/NP ,/, which/WDT owned/VBD about/IN 7/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT company/NN 's/POS voting/NN stock/NN ,/, worked/VBD with/IN management/NN to/TO devise/VB a/DT time-limited/JJ poison/NN pill/NN ./. 
This/DT pill/NN automatically/RB expires/VBZ after/IN three/CD years/NNS unless/IN continued/VBN by/IN a/DT vote/NN of/IN the/DT shareholders/NNS ./. 
The/DT attitude/NN of/IN the/DT Wisconsin/NP Investment/NP Board/NP reflects/VBZ a/DT growing/VBG receptivity/NN to/TO time-limited/JJ poison/NN pills/NNS on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN institutional/JJ investors/NNS ,/, as/IN shown/VBN by/IN the/DT discussions/NNS at/IN recent/JJ meetings/NNS of/IN the/DT Council/NP of/IN Institutional/NP Investors/NPS and/CC my/PP$ informal/JJ survey/NN of/IN several/JJ retirement/NN plans/NNS with/IN large/JJ stock/NN positions/NNS ./. 
More/RBR widespread/JJ time/NN limits/NNS on/IN poison/NN pills/NNS would/MD allow/VB shareholders/NNS to/TO evaluate/VB a/DT specific/JJ poison/NN pill/NN within/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN a/DT specific/JJ management/NN team/NN 's/POS strategy/NN ./. 
Such/JJ concrete/JJ analysis/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO lead/VB to/TO more/RBR fruitful/JJ dialogue/NN between/IN management/NN and/CC shareholders/NNS than/IN the/DT abstract/JJ debate/NN about/IN poison/NN pills/NNS ./.

Why/WRB ?/. 
So/RB far/RB ,/, Nissan/NP 's/POS new-model/NN successes/NNS are/VBP mostly/RB specialized/JJ vehicles/NNS with/IN limited/JJ sales/NNS potential/NN ./. 
In/IN compact/NN and/CC subcompact/NN cars/NNS ,/, the/DT bread-and-butter/JJ sales/NNS generators/NNS for/IN Japanese/JJ auto/NN makers/NNS ,/, Nissan/NP still/RB trails/VBZ Toyota/NP and/CC Honda/NP ./. 
Nissan/NP hopes/VBZ that/IN that/DT will/MD start/VB to/TO change/VB this/DT fall/NN ,/, with/IN its/PP$ new/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT Stanza/NP compact/JJ sedan/NN ./. 
The/DT Stanza/NP has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT nonentity/NN compared/VBN with/IN Honda/NP 's/POS hugely/RB successful/JJ Accord/NP and/CC Toyota/NP 's/POS Camry/NP ./. 
But/CC this/DT year/NN ,/, Honda/NP has/VBZ revamped/VBN the/DT Accord/NP and/CC made/VBD it/PP a/DT midsized/JJ car/NN ./. 
Nissan/NP instead/RB has/VBZ kept/VBN its/PP$ new/JJ Stanza/NP a/DT bit/RB smaller/JJR than/IN that/DT and/CC cut/VBN the/DT base/JJ price/NN 6/CD %/NN ;/: at/IN $/$ 11,450/CD ,/, Stanza/NP prices/NNS start/VBP $/$ 749/CD below/IN the/DT predecessor/NN model/NN yet/RB have/VBP a/DT more-powerful/JJR engine/NN ./.

Nissan/NP 's/POS risk/NN is/VBZ that/IN its/PP$ low-base-price/JJ strategy/NN might/MD get/VB lost/VBN amid/IN the/DT highly/RB publicized/JJ rebates/NNS being/VBG offered/VBN by/IN Detroit/NP 's/POS Big/JJ Three/CD ./.

At/IN the/DT opposite/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, Nissan/NP launches/VBZ its/PP$ luxury/NN Infiniti/NP division/NN on/IN Nov./NP 8/CD --/: three/CD years/NNS after/IN Honda/NN pioneered/VBD Japanese/JJ luxury/NN cars/NNS and/CC two/CD months/NNS after/IN Toyota/NP 's/POS Lexus/NP went/VBD on/IN sale/NN ./. 
Nissan/NP started/VBD advertising/VBG Infiniti/NP fully/RB eight/CD months/NNS before/IN the/DT cars/NNS hit/VBD American/JJ showrooms/NNS ./. 
The/DT ads/NNS featured/VBD fences/NNS ,/, rocks/NNS and/CC pussy-willow/NN buds/NNS --/: almost/RB anything/NN but/CC the/DT cars/NNS themselves/PP ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, Nissan/NP 's/POS sales/NNS goals/NNS for/IN Infiniti/NP are/VBP modest/JJ compared/VBN with/IN Toyota/NP 's/POS targets/NNS for/IN Lexus/NP ./.

He/PP figures/VBZ Akzo/NP is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ major/JJ chemical/NN companies/NNS to/TO show/VB profit/NN growth/NN next/IN year/NN ./. 
The/DT bank/NN projects/VBZ Akzo/NP will/MD show/VB per-share/JJ earnings/NNS of/IN 24/CD guilders/NNS in/IN 1990/CD ,/, up/RB from/IN an/DT estimated/VBN 22.5/CD guilders/NNS for/IN this/DT year/NN and/CC the/DT 20.9/CD guilders/NNS reported/VBN for/IN 1988/CD ./. 
At/IN James/NP Capel/NP &/CC Co./NP in/IN London/NP ,/, analyst/NN Jackie/NP Ashurst/NP notes/VBZ that/IN Akzo/NP is/VBZ less/RBR exposed/VBN than/IN many/JJ of/IN its/PP$ rivals/NNS to/TO the/DT most/RBS volatile/JJ chemical/NN products/NNS ./. 
For/IN example/NN ,/, Akzo/NP has/VBZ only/RB minor/JJ petrochemical/NN operations/NNS ,/, is/VBZ small/JJ in/IN plastics/NNS and/CC does/VBZ n't/RB make/VB fertilizers/NNS ./. 
Thus/RB ,/, while/IN Akzo/NP profited/VBD less/JJR than/IN many/JJ rivals/NNS from/IN the/DT boom/NN of/IN recent/JJ years/NNS in/IN petrochemicals/NNS and/CC plastics/NNS ,/, it/PP has/VBZ less/JJR to/TO fear/VB from/IN the/DT current/JJ slump/NN ./. 
The/DT company/NN is/VBZ exposed/VBN to/TO bulk/NN chemicals/NNS ,/, however/RB ./. 
Although/IN bulk-chemical/JJ prices/NNS have/VBP begun/VBN falling/VBG in/IN the/DT U.S./NP ,/, they/PP are/VBP generally/RB stable/JJ in/IN Europe/NP ,/, Mr./NP Bergsma/NP said/VBD ./. 
A/DT decline/NN may/MD come/VB in/IN the/DT first/JJ half/NN of/IN 1990/CD ,/, he/PP said/VBD ,/, but/CC the/DT market/NN does/VBZ n't/RB appear/VB on/IN the/DT verge/NN of/IN a/DT severe/JJ downturn/NN ./. 
To/TO reduce/VB the/DT danger/NN of/IN such/JJ pricing/NN cycles/NNS ,/, Akzo/NP has/VBZ invested/VBN heavily/RB in/IN specialty/NN chemicals/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP highly/RB specific/JJ industrial/JJ uses/NNS and/CC tend/VBP to/TO produce/VB much/JJ higher/JJR profit/NN margins/NNS than/IN do/VBP bulk/JJ chemicals/NNS ./. 
Akzo/NP 's/POS biggest/JJS move/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN was/VBD the/DT 1987/CD acquisition/NN of/IN Stauffer/NP Chemical/NP Co./NP 's/POS specialty/NN chemical/NN business/NN for/IN $/$ 625/CD million/CD ./. 
In/IN a/DT less/RBR glamorous/JJ field/NN ,/, Akzo/NP is/VBZ the/DT world/NN 's/POS biggest/JJS producer/NN of/IN industrial/JJ salt/NN ,/, used/VBD as/IN a/DT raw/JJ material/NN for/IN the/DT chemical/JJ industry/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN for/IN such/JJ tasks/NNS as/IN melting/VBG ice/NN ./. 
Akzo/NP also/RB makes/VBZ products/NNS derived/VBN from/IN salt/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN chlorine/NN and/CC caustic/JJ soda/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT fibers/NNS division/NN ,/, profit/NN remains/VBZ weak/JJ ,/, largely/RB because/IN of/IN persistent/JJ overcapacity/NN ./. 
But/CC Akzo/NP is/VBZ still/RB slimming/VBG down/IN :/: It/PP recently/RB announced/VBD plans/NNS to/TO eliminate/VB about/IN 1,700/CD fiber-related/JJ jobs/NNS in/IN the/DT Netherlands/NP and/CC West/NP Germany/NP ./. 
Although/IN the/DT polyester/NN and/CC rayon/NN markets/NNS remain/VBP mostly/RB bleak/JJ ,/, Akzo/NP has/VBZ high/JJ hopes/NNS for/IN some/DT emerging/VBG fiber/NN businesses/NNS ,/, such/JJ carbon/NN fibers/NNS and/CC aramid/NN ,/, extremely/RB strong/JJ fibers/NNS used/VBN to/TO reinforce/VB tires/NNS and/CC metals/NNS and/CC to/TO make/VB such/JJ products/NNS as/IN bullet-proof/JJ vests/NNS ./. 
Akzo/NP 's/POS Twaron/NP aramid/NN fiber/NN is/VBZ a/DT distant/JJ second/NN to/TO Du/NP Pont/NP Co./NP 's/POS Kevlar/NP ,/, which/WDT dominates/VBZ the/DT market/NN ./. 
Mr./NP Bergsma/NP said/VBD world-wide/JJ industry/NN sales/NNS of/IN aramid/NN fibers/NNS are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO total/VB about/IN $/$ 500/CD million/CD this/DT year/NN ./. 
Sales/NNS growth/NN of/IN 10/CD %/NN a/DT year/NN seems/VBZ possible/JJ ,/, he/PP said/VBD ,/, and/CC Akzo/NP expects/VBZ its/PP$ Twaron/NP business/NN to/TO become/VB profitable/JJ in/IN 1990/CD ./. 
Akzo/NP also/RB has/VBZ spent/VBN heavily/RB on/IN acquisitions/NNS in/IN paints/NNS ,/, auto/NN finishes/NNS and/CC industrial/JJ coatings/NNS ./. 
In/IN August/NP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, it/PP completed/VBD the/DT $/$ 110/CD million/CD acquisition/NN of/IN Reliance/NP Universal/NP Inc./NP ,/, a/DT U.S./NP maker/NN of/IN industrial/JJ coatings/NNS for/IN wood/NN ,/, metals/NNS and/CC plastics/NNS ,/, from/IN Tyler/NP Corp/NP ./. 
Mr./NP Bergsma/NP said/VBD Akzo/NP is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO see/VB strong/JJ profit/NN growth/NN from/IN coatings/NNS as/IN it/PP realizes/VBZ cost/NN savings/NNS and/CC other/JJ benefits/NNS from/IN its/PP$ greater/JJR scale/NN ./. 
For/IN Akzo/NP 's/POS drug/NN business/NN ,/, where/WRB profits/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN litle/JJ change/NN for/IN the/DT past/JJ five/CD years/NNS ,/, Mr./NP Bergsma/NP predicted/VBD moderate/JJ profit/NN growth/NN ./. 
Akzo/NP is/VBZ the/DT leading/VBG seller/NN of/IN birth-control/JJ pills/NNS in/IN Europe/NP but/CC is/VBZ still/RB seeking/VBG regulatory/JJ approvals/NNS to/TO enter/VB that/DT market/NN in/IN the/DT U.S./NP and/CC Japan/NP ./. 
Mr./NP Bergsma/NP said/VBD Akzo/NP hopes/VBZ to/TO have/VB approval/NN to/TO sell/VB its/PP$ Marvelon/NP pill/NN in/IN the/DT U.S./NP in/IN 1992/CD ./. 
Akzo/NP also/RB has/VBZ small/JJ operations/NNS in/IN diagnostic/JJ tests/NNS ,/, generic/JJ drugs/NNS and/CC veterinary/JJ products/NNS ./. 
Veterinary/JJ products/NNS are/VBP showing/VBG especially/RB strong/JJ growth/NN ,/, Mr./NP Bergsma/NP said/VBD ./. 
Among/IN the/DT leading/VBG products/NNS is/VBZ a/DT flu/NN shot/NN for/IN horses/NNS ./. 
We/PP 're/VBP sorry/JJ to/TO see/VB Nigel/NP Lawson/NP 's/POS departure/NN from/IN the/DT British/JJ government/NN ./. 
He/PP is/VBZ a/DT politician/NN with/IN the/DT courage/NN of/IN true/JJ conviction/NN ,/, as/IN in/IN summarily/RB sacking/VBG exchange/NN controls/NNS and/CC in/IN particular/JJ slashing/VBG the/DT top/JJ rate/NN of/IN income/NN taxation/NN to/TO 40/CD %/NN ./. 
But/CC in/IN the/DT end/NN his/PP$ resignation/NN as/IN Chancellor/NP of/IN the/DT Exchequer/NP may/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ thing/NN ,/, especially/RB if/IN it/PP works/VBZ as/IN he/PP no/DT doubt/NN intends/VBZ --/: by/IN forcing/VBG Prime/NP Minister/NP Thatcher/NP and/CC her/PP$ counterparts/NNS elsewhere/RB to/TO confront/VB the/DT genuine/JJ intellectual/JJ issues/NNS involved/VBN ./. 
The/DT early/JJ omens/NNS ,/, we/PP admit/VBP ,/, scarcely/RB suggest/VBP so/RB wholesome/JJ an/DT outcome/NN ./. 
The/DT Fleet/NP Street/NP reaction/NN was/VBD captured/VBN in/IN the/DT Guardian/NP headline/NN ,/, ``/`` Departure/NN Reveals/VBZ Thatcher/NP Poison/NN ./. 
''/'' British/JJ politicians/NNS divide/VBP into/IN two/CD groups/NNS of/IN chickens/NNS ,/, those/DT with/IN their/PP$ necks/NNS cut/VBN and/CC those/DT screaming/VBG the/DT sky/NN is/VBZ falling/VBG ./. 
So/RB far/RB as/IN we/PP can/MD see/VB only/RB two/CD persons/NNS are/VBP behaving/VBG with/IN a/DT dignity/NN recognizing/VBG the/DT seriousness/NN of/IN the/DT issues/NNS :/: Mr./NP Lawson/NP and/CC Sir/NP Alan/NP Walters/NP ,/, the/DT counterpoint/NN of/IN the/DT Chancellor/NP 's/POS difficulties/NNS ,/, who/WP also/RB resigned/VBD as/IN personal/JJ adviser/NN to/TO Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP ./. 
The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN on/IN the/DT vital/JJ issue/NN of/IN monetary/JJ policy/NN and/CC exchange/NN rates/NNS ,/, conservative/JJ ,/, free-market/JJ economists/NNS divide/VBP into/IN at/IN least/JJS three/CD incompatible/JJ camps/NNS ./. 
There/EX are/VBP the/DT strict/JJ monetarists/NNS ,/, who/WP believe/VBP that/IN floating/VBG exchange/NN rates/NNS free/VBP an/DT economy/NN to/TO stabilize/VB its/PP$ price/NN level/NN by/IN stabilizing/VBG the/DT monetary/JJ aggregates/NNS ./. 
There/EX are/VBP the/DT supply-side/JJ globalists/NNS ,/, who/WP seek/VBP to/TO spread/VB the/DT advantages/NNS of/IN a/DT common/JJ currency/NN through/IN fixed/VBN exchange/NN rates/NNS ./. 
And/CC there/EX are/VBP the/DT twin-deficit/NN Keynesians/NPS ,/, who/WP predict\/VBP devaluations/NNS to/TO balance/VB trade/NN flows/NNS ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT problem/NN not/RB only/RB for/IN Prime/NP Minister/NP Thatcher/NP but/CC for/IN President/NP Bush/NP ,/, as/IN shown/VBN in/IN the/DT ongoing/JJ bickering/NN over/IN the/DT dollar/NN between/IN the/DT Federal/NP Reserve/NP and/CC the/DT Mulford/NP Treasury/NP ./. 
In/IN the/DT British/JJ case/NN ,/, Mr./NP Lawson/NP is/VBZ the/DT closest/JJS thing/NN in/IN London/NP to/TO a/DT supply-side/JJ globalist/NN ./. 
He/PP not/RB only/RB slashed/VBD marginal/JJ tax/NN rates/NNS ,/, initially/RB sparking/VBG fresh/JJ growth/NN in/IN Britain/NP ,/, but/CC he/PP wanted/VBD to/TO regulate/VB monetary/JJ policy/NN by/IN targeting/VBG exchange/NN rates/NNS ,/, indeed/RB joining/VBG the/DT European/NP Monetary/NP System/NP ./. 
While/IN no/DT doubt/NN agreeing/VBG with/IN Mr./NP Lawson/NP on/IN everything/NN else/RB ,/, Sir/NP Alan/NP is/VBZ a/DT dyed-in-the-wool/JJ monetarist/NN ,/, inclined/VBN to/TO defend/VB floating/VBG rates/NNS to/TO the/DT death/NN ./. 
To/TO make/VB matters/NNS even/RB more/RBR confusing/JJ ,/, the/DT earlier/JJR U.S./NP experience/NN made/VBD clear/JJ that/IN Mr./NP Lawson/NP 's/POS tax/NN cuts/NNS would/MD have/VB profound/JJ effects/NNS on/IN Britain/NP 's/POS international/JJ accounts/NNS and/CC the/DT value/NN of/IN sterling/NN ./. 
They/PP increased/VBD the/DT after-tax/JJ rate/NN of/IN return/NN and/CC made/VBD Britain/NP a/DT far/RB more/RBR attractive/JJ place/NN to/TO invest/VB ,/, producing/VBG sudden/JJ capital/NN inflows/NNS ./. 
By/IN accounting/VBG definitions/NNS ,/, this/DT had/VBD to/TO produce/VB a/DT sudden/JJ trade/NN deficit/NN ./. 
As/IN in/IN the/DT U.S./NP ,/, it/PP also/RB produced/VBD a/DT sudden/JJ burst/NN in/IN the/DT demand/NN for/IN sterling/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ a/DT surge/NN in/IN the/DT sterling/NN monetary/JJ aggregates/NNS ,/, M-Whatever/NN ./. 
At/IN this/DT point/NN ,/, the/DT options/NNS were/VBD :/: Crunch/VB money/NN to/TO stop/VB the/DT boost/NN in/IN the/DT aggregates/NNS ,/, as/IN Sir/NP Alan/NP surely/RB advised/VBD ,/, and/CC forget/VB the/DT soaring/VBG pound/NN ./. 
To/TO push/VB the/DT pound/NN even/RB lower/RBR trying/VBG to/TO cure/VB the/DT trade/NN deficit/NN ,/, a/DT policy/NN Britain/NP has/VBZ repeatedly/RB proved/VBN disastrous/JJ ./. 
Or/CC to/TO supply/VB enough/JJ money/NN to/TO meet/VB the/DT increased/VBN demand/NN and/CC stabilize/VB the/DT exchange/NN rate/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT Chancellor/NP argued/VBD ,/, and/CC ensure/VB the/DT permanence/NN of/IN this/DT policy/NN by/IN joining/VBG the/DT EMS/NP ./. 
Faced/VBN with/IN a/DT similar/JJ situation/NN ,/, Paul/NP Volcker/NP let/VBD the/DT dollar/NN soar/VB ,/, (/( though/IN monetary/JJ aggregates/NNS also/RB grew/VBD so/RB rapidly/RB monetarists/NNS issued/VBD egg-on-the-face/JJ warnings/NNS of/IN inflation/NN )/) ./. 
But/CC this/DT devastated/VBD the/DT U.S./NP manufacturing/NN sector/NN ,/, laying/VBG the/DT seeds/NNS of/IN protectionism/NN ./. 
Mr./NP Lawson/NP ,/, though/IN not/RB allowed/VBN to/TO join/VB the/DT EMS/NP ,/, chose/VBD to/TO ``/`` shadow/VB ''/'' the/DT deutsche/NN mark/NN ./. 
He/PP reaped/VBD inflation/NN along/IN with/IN rapid/JJ growth/NN ,/, no/DT doubt/NN validating/VBG Sir/NP Alan/NP 's/POS predictions/NNS in/IN the/DT Prime/NP Minister/NP 's/POS mind/NN ./. 
But/CC more/RBR recently/RB ,/, the/DT pound/NN has/VBZ been/VBN falling/VBG with/IN high/JJ inflation/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ also/RB seemed/VBN almost/RB impervious/JJ to/TO the/DT high/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS Mr./NP Lawson/NP deployed/VBD to/TO stop/VB it/PP ./. 
So/IN the/DT British/JJ experience/NN presents/VBZ a/DT genuine/JJ puzzle/NN that/WDT reaches/VBZ far/RB beyond/IN the/DT shores/NNS of/IN Albion/NP ./. 
We/PP had/VBD been/VBN soliciting/VBG opinions/NNS on/IN it/PP long/JJ before/IN Mr./NP Lawson/NP 's/POS resignation/NN ,/, and/CC offer/VBP some/DT of/IN the/DT collection/NN for/IN the/DT benefit/NN of/IN his/PP$ successor/NN and/CC one-time/JJ deputy/NN ,/, John/NP Major/NP ./. 
To/TO begin/VB with/IN ,/, we/PP should/MD note/VB that/IN in/IN contrast/NN to/TO the/DT U.S./NP deficit/NN ,/, Britain/NP has/VBZ been/VBN running/VBG largish/JJ budget/NN surpluses/NNS ./. 
In/IN pursuit/NN of/IN this/DT mystery/NN ,/, Keynesian/JJ adepts/NNS and/CC twin-deficit/NN mavens/NNS need/MD not/RB apply/VB ./. 
We/PP should/MD also/RB add/VB Mr./NP Lawson/NP 's/POS own/JJ explanation/NN ,/, as/IN we/PP understand/VBP it/PP ./. 
Unlike/IN the/DT U.S./NP ,/, Britain/NP never/RB achieved/VBD even/RB a/DT momentary/JJ reduction/NN in/IN real/JJ wages/NNS ./. 
The/DT wage/NN stickiness/NN ,/, which/WDT OECD/NP studies/NNS confirm/VBP is/VBZ particularly/RB high/JJ in/IN Britain/NP ,/, gives/VBZ its/PP$ economy/NN a/DT structural/JJ bias/NN toward/IN inflation/NN ./. 
Inflation/NN is/VBZ easier/JJR to/TO spark/VB and/CC harder/JJR to/TO control/VB ./. 
We/PP should/MD also/RB concede/VB that/IN in/IN the/DT British/JJ experience/NN the/DT monetarist/NN cause/NN regains/VBZ some/DT of/IN the/DT credibility/NN it/PP lost/VBD in/IN the/DT U.S./NP experience/NN ./. 
Nearby/JJ Paul/NP Craig/NP Roberts/NP ,/, a/DT distinguished/VBN supply-sider/NN with/IN monetarist/NN sympathies/NNS ,/, argues/VBZ the/DT case/NN for/IN Sir/NP Alan/NP ./. 
Perhaps/RB the/DT fiscal/JJ shock/NN of/IN tax/NN cuts/NNS is/VBZ after/IN all/DT best/JJS absorbed/VBN by/IN floating/VBG rates/NNS ,/, though/IN of/IN course/NN in/IN the/DT event/NN Mr./NP Lawson/NP resigned/VBD over/IN whether/IN to/TO support/VB a/DT weak/JJ pound/NN ,/, not/RB restrain/VB a/DT strong/JJ one/CD ./. 
We/PP recall/VBP that/IN Mr./NP Roberts/NP not/RB only/RB chides/VBZ the/DT Chancellor/NP for/IN being/VBG too/RB easy/RB because/IN of/IN a/DT desire/NN to/TO constrain/VB sterling/JJ ,/, but/CC also/RB led/VBD the/DT chorus/NN saying/VBG that/IN Mr./NP Volcker/NP was/VBD too/RB tight/JJ when/WRB he/PP let/VBD the/DT dollar/NN rise/NN ./. 
Somewhere/RB in/IN between/IN there/EX must/MD be/VB a/DT golden/JJ mean/NN ,/, perhaps/RB measured/VBN by/IN M-Whatever/NP ,/, but/CC perhaps/RB measured/VBN by/IN purchasing/VBG power/NN parity/NN ./. 
The/DT globalists/NNS tend/VBP to/TO think/VB Mr./NP Lawson/NP ran/VBD onto/IN technical/JJ reefs/NNS ./. 
In/IN fixing/VBG rates/NNS the/DT choice/NN of/IN initial/JJ parities/NNS is/VBZ crucial/JJ ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, and/CC perhaps/RB he/PP picked/VBD the/DT wrong/JJ pound-DM/JJ rate/NN ./. 
For/IN that/DT matter/NN ,/, perhaps/RB he/PP fixed/VBD to/TO the/DT wrong/JJ currency/NN ./. 
We/PP sympathize/VBP with/IN Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP 's/POS reluctance/NN to/TO tie/VB her/PP$ currency/NN to/TO one/CD governed/VBN by/IN the/DT domestic/JJ political/JJ imperatives/NNS of/IN West/NP Germany/NP ./. 
Perhaps/RB the/DT shock/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN less/JJR if/IN they/PP 'd/VBD fixed/VBN to/TO another/DT low-tax/NN ,/, deregulated/VBN ,/, supply-side/JJ economy/NN ./. 
Alan/NP Reynolds/NP of/IN Polyconomics/NP adds/VBZ his/PP$ suspicion/NN that/IN the/DT unrecognized/JJ inflationary/JJ culprit/NN is/VBZ the/DT budget/NN surplus/NN ./. 
Those/DT who/WP can/MD shake/VB Keynesian/JJ ghosts/NNS out/IN of/IN their/PP$ heads/NNS might/MD recognize/VB that/IN the/DT retirement/NN of/IN gilts/NNS for/IN cash/NN is/VBZ equivalent/JJ to/TO an/DT expansionary/JJ open-market/NN operation/NN ,/, indeed/RB ,/, it/PP is/VBZ the/DT definition/NN of/IN an/DT open/JJ market/NN operation/NN to/TO expand/VB the/DT money/NN supply/NN ./. 
Mr./NP Reynolds/NP also/RB notes/VBZ that/IN since/IN British/JJ banks/NNS have/VBP no/DT reserve/NN requirements/NNS ,/, high/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS are/VBP less/RBR likely/JJ to/TO curb/VB inflation/NN than/IN to/TO cause/VB recession/NN ./. 
We/PP would/MD add/VB that/IN in/IN political/JJ terms/NNS ,/, Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP 's/POS problem/NN was/VBD failing/VBG to/TO decide/VB between/IN the/DT Chancellor/NP and/CC her/PP$ adviser/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, neither/DT policy/NN was/VBD followed/VBN ,/, and/CC instead/RB of/IN learning/VBG anything/NN we/PP are/VBP left/VBN with/IN a/DT mystery/NN ./. 
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, ``/`` shadowing/VBG ''/'' a/DT currency/NN is/VBZ anything/NN but/CC fixing/VBG ;/: it/PP is/VBZ an/DT open/JJ announcement/NN that/IN the/DT exchange/NN rate/NN target/NN has/VBZ no/DT credibility/NN ./. 
All/PDT the/DT more/RBR so/RB when/WRB strong/JJ voices/NNS are/VBP heard/VBN opposing/VBG the/DT policy/NN ./. 
Better/JJR to/TO have/VB a/DT true/JJ monetarist/NN policy/NN ,/, just/RB for/IN the/DT experience/NN ./. 
So/IN Mr./NP Lawson/NP had/VBD to/TO resign/VB ./. 
In/IN the/DT end/NN his/PP$ move/NN was/VBD sparked/VBN by/IN remarks/NNS in/IN excerpts/NNS from/IN Sir/NP Alan/NP 's/POS autobiography/NN in/IN The/DT American/NP Economist/NP ,/, a/DT 10,000-circulation/JJ academic/JJ journal/NN ./.

They/PP confront/VBP stubborn/JJ inflation/NN and/CC a/DT sagging/VBG economy/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB ,/, stagflation/NN ./. 
This/DT can/MD not/RB be/VB solved/VBN by/IN provoking/VBG a/DT further/JJ downturn/NN ;/: reducing/VBG the/DT supply/NN of/IN goods/NNS does/VBZ not/RB solve/VB inflation/NN ./. 
Our/PP$ advice/NN is/VBZ this/DT :/: Immediately/RB return/VB the/DT government/NN surpluses/NNS to/TO the/DT economy/NN through/IN incentive-maximizing/JJ tax/NN cuts/NNS ,/, and/CC find/VB some/DT monetary/JJ policy/NN target/NN that/WDT balances/VBZ both/DT supply/NN and/CC demand/NN for/IN money/NN (/( which/WDT neither/DT aggregates/NNS nor/CC interest/NN rates/NNS can/MD do/VB )/) ./.

That/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT huge/JJ problem/NN if/IN it/PP were/VBD to/TO continue/VB ,/, because/IN Unisys/NP is/VBZ betting/VBG its/PP$ business/NN on/IN the/DT assumption/NN that/IN customers/NNS want/VBP to/TO move/VB away/RB from/IN using/VBG operating/VBG systems/NNS that/WDT run/VBP on/IN only/RB one/CD manufacturer/NN 's/POS equipment/NN and/CC toward/IN systems/NNS --/: mainly/RB Unix/NP --/: that/WDT work/VBP on/IN almost/RB anyone/NN 's/POS machines/NNS ./.

Last/JJ week/NN the/DT British/NPS displayed/VBD unusual/JJ political/JJ immaturity/NN ./.

The/DT British/JJ press/NN ,/, making/VBG a/DT mountain/NN out/IN of/IN a/DT molehill/NN ,/, precipitated/VBD an/DT unnecessary/JJ economic/JJ crisis/NN by/IN portraying/VBG Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP as/IN an/DT autocrat/NN who/WP had/VBD thrown/VBN economic/JJ policy/NN into/IN confusion/NN by/IN driving/VBG a/DT respected/VBN figure/NN from/IN her/PP$ government/NN ./. 
Behind/IN the/DT silly/JJ posturing/NN lies/VBZ a/DT real/JJ dispute/NN ./. 
Mr./NP Lawson/NP and/CC his/PP$ European-minded/JJ colleagues/NNS want/VBP the/DT British/JJ pound/NN formally/RB tied/VBN to/TO the/DT West/JJ German/JJ mark/NN ./. 
Sir/NP Alan/NP considers/VBZ this/DT an/DT ill-advised/JJ and/CC costly/JJ policy/NN ./. 
As/IN there/EX is/VBZ an/DT effort/NN to/TO ``/`` anchor/VB the/DT dollar/NN ''/'' either/CC to/TO gold/NN or/CC other/JJ currencies/NNS ,/, the/DT dispute/NN is/VBZ worth/JJ examining/VBG ./. 
Until/IN his/PP$ resignation/NN ,/, Mr./NP Lawson/NP had/VBD been/VBN conducting/VBG British/JJ monetary/JJ policy/NN as/IN if/IN the/DT pound/NN were/VBD tied/VBN to/TO the/DT mark/NN ./. 
When/WRB Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP cut/VBD the/DT top/JJ tax/NN rate/NN to/TO 40/CD %/NN ,/, Mr./NP Lawson/NP flooded/VBD the/DT country/NN with/IN money/NN to/TO prevent/VB the/DT pound/NN from/IN rising/VBG against/IN the/DT mark/NN ./. 
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, he/PP reignited/VBD the/DT inflation/NN that/IN Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP ,/, through/IN a/DT long/JJ and/CC costly/JJ effort/NN ,/, had/VBD subdued/VBN ./. 
With/IN inflation/NN surging/VBG ,/, the/DT pound/NN began/VBD falling/VBG against/IN the/DT mark/NN ./. 
To/TO keep/VB the/DT exchange/NN rate/NN pegged/VBD ,/, Mr./NP Lawson/NP tightened/VBD monetary/JJ policy/NN and/CC pushed/VBD interest/NN rates/NNS up/RB to/TO 15/CD %/NN ./. 
This/DT doubled/VBD the/DT mortgage/NN interest/NN rates/NNS of/IN the/DT many/JJ new/JJ homeowners/NNS that/IN Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP 's/POS policies/NNS had/VBD created/VBN ,/, producing/VBG widespread/JJ disaffection/NN and/CC pushing/VBG Labor/NN ahead/RB in/IN the/DT polls/NNS ./. 
Instead/RB of/IN realizing/VBG his/PP$ mistake/NN in/IN letting/VBG the/DT exchange/NN rate/NN dominate/VB both/DT British/JJ economic/JJ policy/NN and/CC Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP 's/POS political/JJ fortune/NN ,/, Mr./NP Lawson/NP pushed/VBD for/IN tying/VBG the/DT pound/NN formally/RB to/TO the/DT mark/NN by/IN entering/VBG the/DT European/NP Monetary/NP System/NP ,/, which/WDT subordinates/VBZ all/DT member/NN currencies/NNS to/TO German/JJ monetary/JJ policy/NN ./. 
This/DT put/VBD Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP in/IN a/DT bind/NN ./. 
The/DT concept/NN of/IN European/JJ integration/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN those/DT grand/JJ schemes/NNS that/WDT appeal/VBP to/TO intellectuals/NNS ,/, the/DT media/NNS and/CC the/DT imagination/NN ,/, but/CC are/VBP full/JJ of/IN practical/JJ pitfalls/NNS ./. 
If/IN the/DT pound/NN had/VBD been/VBN tied/VBN to/TO the/DT mark/NN ,/, the/DT British/NPS would/MD have/VB been/VBN unable/JJ to/TO cut/VB their/PP$ exorbitant/JJ tax/NN rates/NNS ./. 
The/DT reason/NN is/VBZ simple/JJ ./. 
When/WRB a/DT country/NN cuts/VBZ tax/NN rates/NNS ,/, it/PP makes/VBZ itself/PP more/RBR attractive/JJ to/TO investors/NNS and/CC drives/VBZ up/RP the/DT value/NN of/IN its/PP$ currency/NN ./. 
It/PP was/VBD fear/NN of/IN disturbing/VBG EMS/NP exchange-rate/JJ relationships/NNS that/WDT caused/VBD the/DT Chirac/NP government/NN in/IN France/NP to/TO be/VB timid/JJ about/IN cutting/VBG tax/NN rates/NNS ./. 
Edouard/NP Balladur/NP ,/, the/DT finance/NN minister/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, was/VBD sold/VBN on/IN the/DT tax-cut/JJ policy/NN but/CC was/VBD concerned/VBN that/IN his/PP$ government/NN would/MD be/VB criticized/VBN as/IN anti-European/JJ for/IN disturbing/VBG the/DT linked/VBN European/JJ currency/NN relationship/NN ./. 
The/DT price/NN of/IN attracting/VBG capital/NN --/: whether/IN one/NN 's/POS own/JJ or/CC that/IN of/IN foreigners/NNS --/: is/VBZ a/DT trade/NN deficit/NN ./. 
To/TO avoid/VB this/DT deficit/NN Mr./NP Lawson/NP inflated/VBD the/DT pound/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO prevent/VB its/PP$ rise/NN ./. 
This/DT misguided/JJ policy/NN could/MD not/RB prevent/VB a/DT British/JJ trade/NN deficit/NN ./. 
Consequently/RB ,/, Mr./NP Lawson/NP saddled/VBD Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP with/IN a/DT record/NN trade/NN deficit/NN ,/, renewed/VBN inflation/NN and/CC high/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS --/: three/CD political/JJ failures/NNS in/IN a/DT row/NN ./. 
Little/JJ wonder/NN that/IN Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP 's/POS opponents/NNS were/VBD so/RB anxious/JJ to/TO keep/VB Mr./NP Lawson/NP in/IN office/NN ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ extraordinary/JJ that/IN the/DT British/NP Treasury/NP thought/VBD it/PP could/MD prevent/VB a/DT trade/NN deficit/NN by/IN inflating/VBG the/DT pound/NN ./. 
The/DT British/JJ balance-of-payments/NNS statistics/NNS show/VBP that/IN after/IN the/DT top/JJ tax/NN rate/NN was/VBD cut/VBN to/TO 40/CD %/NN ,/, the/DT flow/NN abroad/RB of/IN British/JJ capital/NN slowed/VBD ,/, to/TO 50/CD billion/CD pounds/NNS (/( $/$ 79/CD billion/CD at/IN the/DT current/JJ rate/NN )/) in/IN 1988/CD from/IN 93/CD billion/CD pounds/NNS in/IN 1986/CD ./. 
This/DT change/NN in/IN the/DT British/JJ capital/NN account/NN required/VBD an/DT offsetting/VBG change/NN in/IN the/DT trade/NN account/NN ,/, a/DT change/NN that/WDT could/MD not/RB be/VB prevented/VBN by/IN pegging/VBG the/DT currency/NN ./. 
Nigel/NP Lawson/NP was/VBD a/DT victim/NN of/IN the/DT immense/JJ confusion/NN in/IN thought/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN characteristic/JJ of/IN Western/JJ financial/JJ circles/NNS during/IN the/DT 1980s/CD ./. 
The/DT most/RBS important/JJ governments/NNS have/VBP ignored/VBN the/DT role/NN of/IN low/JJ tax/NN rates/NNS in/IN attracting/VBG real/JJ capital/NN investment/NN ,/, instead/RB emphasizing/VBG financial/JJ flows/NNS in/IN response/NN to/TO high/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS ./. 
This/DT has/VBZ led/VBN them/PP in/IN a/DT fruitless/JJ and/CC destructive/JJ policy/NN circle/NN ./. 
First/RB comes/VBZ monetary/JJ expansion/NN to/TO drive/VB down/IN the/DT currency/NN 's/POS value/NN that/WDT was/VBD pushed/VBN up/IN by/IN tax-rate/JJ reduction/NN ./. 
Then/RB ,/, when/WRB the/DT currency/NN falls/VBZ ,/, interest/NN rates/NNS are/VBP raised/VBN to/TO attract/VB financial/JJ flows/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO stabilize/VB the/DT exchange/NN rate/NN ./. 
This/DT policy/NN is/VBZ totally/RB mindless/JJ ,/, and/CC Sir/NP Alan/NP is/VBZ correct/JJ to/TO point/VB out/IN its/PP$ deficiencies/NNS ./. 
Britain/NP and/CC all/DT of/IN Europe/NP need/VBP to/TO reconsider/VB the/DT prospects/NNS for/IN European/JJ integration/NN in/IN light/NN of/IN the/DT possible/JJ reunification/NN and/CC neutralization/NN of/IN Germany/NP ./. 
A/DT unified/VBN Germany/NP that/WDT remained/VBD within/IN the/DT Western/JJ alliance/NN would/MD give/VB Germany/NP such/PDT an/DT overshadowing/VBG position/NN that/IN all/DT other/JJ members/NNS of/IN a/DT unified/VBN Europe/NP would/MD become/VB vassals/NNS of/IN the/DT German/JJ state/NN ./. 
Unless/IN the/DT Soviet/NP Union/NP collapses/VBZ ,/, German/JJ reunification/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO require/VB Germany/NP 's/POS neutralization/NN ./. 
The/DT implications/NNS for/IN Britain/NP ,/, France/NP and/CC the/DT rest/NN of/IN Europe/NP of/IN having/VBG their/PP$ currencies/NNS tied/VBN to/TO the/DT economic/JJ policy/NN of/IN a/DT neutral/JJ country/NN need/VBP considering/VBG before/IN we/PP judge/VBP Mr./NP Lawson/NP 's/POS resignation/NN to/TO be/VB unfortunate/JJ ./. 
In/IN the/DT least/JJS ,/, we/PP must/MD recognize/VB the/DT futility/NN of/IN trying/VBG to/TO use/VB exchange-rate/JJ intervention/NN to/TO offset/VB the/DT effects/NNS of/IN tax-rate/JJ reduction/NN on/IN capital/NN flows/NNS ./.

And/CC ,/, while/IN the/DT mutinous/JJ Fed/NP member/NN has/VBZ n't/RB gone/VBN public/JJ ,/, some/DT Fed/NP governors/NNS ,/, most/RBS notably/RB Vice/NP Chairman/NP Manuel/NP Johnson/NP ,/, are/VBP known/VBN to/TO have/VB disagreed/VBN with/IN the/DT chairman/NN 's/POS decision/NN to/TO remain/VB silent/JJ ./. 
Ironically/RB ,/, the/DT anonymous/JJ official/NN 's/POS comments/NNS have/VBP earned/VBN some/DT plaudits/NNS for/IN Mr./NP Greenspan/NP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ mistakenly/RB seen/VBN as/IN the/DT source/NN ./. 
At/IN a/DT hearing/NN last/JJ week/NN ,/, Democratic/JJ Sen./NP Chris/NP Dodd/NP of/IN Connecticut/NP told/VBD Treasury/NP Secretary/NP Nicholas/NP Brady/NP that/IN ``/`` Chairman/NP Greenspan/NP 's/POS ''/'' announcement/NN over/IN the/DT Oct./NP 13/CD weekend/NN was/VBD a/DT ``/`` very/RB important/JJ statement/NN ./. 
''/'' Mr./NP Brady/NP hesitantly/RB replied/VBD that/IN he/PP was/VBD n't/RB sure/JJ whether/IN Mr./NP Greenspan/NP ``/`` made/VBD a/DT statement/NN himself/PP ,/, or/CC whether/IN that/DT was/VBD a/DT newspaper/NN report/NN ./. 
''/'' The/DT Fed/NP chairman/NN 's/POS caution/NN was/VBD apparent/JJ again/RB on/IN the/DT Monday/NP morning/NN after/IN the/DT market/NN 's/POS plunge/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT central/JJ bank/NN took/VBD only/RB modest/JJ steps/NNS to/TO aid/VB the/DT markets/NNS ./. 
A/DT surprisingly/RB small/JJ amount/NN of/IN reserves/NNS was/VBD added/VBN to/TO the/DT banking/NN system/NN ./. 
And/CC ,/, by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN that/DT week/NN ,/, the/DT key/JJ federal/JJ funds/NNS interest/NN rate/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ largely/RB controlled/VBN by/IN the/DT Fed/NP ,/, had/VBD settled/VBN at/IN 8.75/CD %/NN ,/, barely/RB changed/VBN from/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN just/RB under/IN 9/CD %/NN that/WDT prevailed/VBD the/DT previous/JJ week/NN ./. 
Bush/NP administration/NN officials/NNS appear/VBP increasingly/RB concerned/VBN that/IN Mr./NP Greenspan/NP is/VBZ cautious/JJ to/TO a/DT fault/NN ./. 
Signs/NNS of/IN growing/VBG weakness/NN in/IN the/DT economy/NN ,/, paired/VBN with/IN indications/NNS that/IN inflation/NN is/VBZ staying/VBG well/RB under/IN control/NN ,/, have/VBP caused/VBN them/PP to/TO wonder/VB why/WRB the/DT Fed/NP chairman/NN is/VBZ so/RB grudging/JJ in/IN reducing/VBG rates/NNS ./. 
Those/DT concerns/NNS are/VBP n't/RB expressed/VBN in/IN public/NN ./. 
In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT administration/NN and/CC the/DT Fed/NP have/VBP been/VBN going/VBG out/IN of/IN their/PP$ way/NN in/IN the/DT past/JJ two/CD weeks/NNS to/TO dispel/VB any/DT impression/NN that/IN they/PP are/VBP at/IN odds/NNS ,/, fearing/VBG stories/NNS about/IN an/DT administration-Fed/JJ split/NN added/VBN to/TO the/DT stock/NN market/NN 's/POS jitters/NNS ./. 
Still/RB ,/, the/DT split/NN is/VBZ there/RB ./. 
The/DT administration/NN 's/POS concerns/NNS are/VBP understandable/JJ ./. 
The/DT economy/NN is/VBZ showing/VBG signs/NNS of/IN weakness/NN ,/, particularly/RB among/IN manufacturers/NNS ./. 
Exports/NNS ,/, which/WDT played/VBD a/DT key/JJ role/NN in/IN fueling/VBG growth/NN over/IN the/DT last/JJ two/CD years/NNS ,/, seem/VBP to/TO have/VB stalled/VBN ./. 
Factory/NN payrolls/NNS and/CC production/NN fell/VBD in/IN September/NP ,/, and/CC the/DT auto/NN industry/NN and/CC housing/NN are/VBP in/IN a/DT severe/JJ crunch/NN ./. 
But/CC Mr./NP Greenspan/NP remains/VBZ reluctant/JJ to/TO loosen/VB policy/NN ,/, partly/RB because/IN he/PP faces/VBZ a/DT phalanx/NN of/IN presidents/NNS of/IN regional/JJ Fed/NP banks/NNS who/WP oppose/VBP credit/NN easing/NN ./. 
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT chairman/NN has/VBZ a/DT wary/JJ eye/NN aimed/VBN a/DT year/NN or/CC two/CD down/IN the/DT road/NN ./. 
Inflation/NN may/MD be/VB stable/JJ at/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, running/VBG at/IN about/IN 4.5/CD %/NN ./. 
But/CC if/IN the/DT Fed/NP eases/VBZ too/RB soon/RB ,/, Mr./NP Greenspan/NP fears/VBZ ,/, prices/NNS may/MD begin/VB to/TO accelerate/VB again/RB next/JJ year/NN ./. 
Moreover/RB ,/, if/IN the/DT Fed/NP holds/VBZ tight/RB ,/, it/PP may/MD be/VB able/JJ gradually/RB to/TO reduce/VB inflation/NN ,/, moving/VBG toward/IN the/DT zero-inflation/NN goal/NN that/IN the/DT Fed/NP chairman/NN embraced/VBD in/IN testimony/NN to/TO Congress/NP last/JJ week/NN ./. 
So/IN far/RB ,/, Mr./NP Greenspan/NP 's/POS cautious/JJ approach/NN to/TO policy/NN has/VBZ served/VBN both/DT him/PP and/CC the/DT nation/NN well/RB ./. 
His/PP$ hand/NN on/IN the/DT monetary/JJ tiller/NN seems/VBZ one/CD reason/NN why/WRB the/DT economy/NN next/JJ month/NN seems/VBZ highly/RB likely/JJ to/TO begin/VB an/DT unprecedented/JJ eighth/JJ year/NN of/IN peacetime/NN growth/NN without/IN a/DT recession/NN ./. 
``/`` We/PP 've/VBP gotten/VBN through/IN two/CD stock/NN market/NN crashes/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PP 've/VBP gone/VBN through/IN an/DT election/NN without/IN any/DT major/JJ problems/NNS ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ David/NP Hale/NP ,/, an/DT economist/NN of/IN Kemper/NP Financial/NP Services/NPS ./.

''/'' But/CC such/JJ caution/NN is/VBZ no/DT guarantee/NN against/IN mistakes/NNS ./.

The/DT $/$ 6/CD billion/CD that/IN some/RB 40/CD companies/NNS are/VBP looking/VBG to/TO raise/VB in/IN the/DT year/NN ending/VBG March/NP 31/CD compares/VBZ with/IN only/RB $/$ 2.7/CD billion/CD raised/VBD on/IN the/DT capital/NN market/NN in/IN the/DT previous/JJ fiscal/JJ year/NN ./.

Mr./NP Thompson/NP believes/VBZ the/DT case/NN for/IN working/VBG together/RB is/VBZ stronger/JJR now/RB than/IN ever/RB ./. 
``/`` The/DT cost/NN of/IN competition/NN has/VBZ become/VBN extremely/RB high/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PP says/VBZ ./.

The/DT Fed/NP already/RB buys/VBZ and/CC sells/VBZ foreign/JJ exchange/NN to/TO prevent/VB disorderly/JJ conditions/NNS in/IN foreign-exchange/NN markets/NNS ./. 
The/DT Fed/NP has/VBZ assumed/VBN a/DT similar/JJ responsibility/NN in/IN the/DT market/NN for/IN government/NN securities/NNS ./.

But/CC would/MD n't/RB it/PP be/VB more/RBR efficient/JJ and/CC effective/JJ to/TO supply/VB such/JJ support/NN to/TO the/DT stock/NN market/NN directly/RB ?/. 
Instead/RB of/IN flooding/VBG the/DT entire/JJ economy/NN with/IN liquidity/NN ,/, and/CC thereby/RB increasing/VBG the/DT danger/NN of/IN inflation/NN ,/, the/DT Fed/NP could/MD support/VB the/DT stock/NN market/NN directly/RB by/IN buying/VBG market/NN averages/NNS in/IN the/DT futures/NNS market/NN ,/, thus/RB stabilizing/VBG the/DT market/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN ./. 
The/DT stock/NN market/NN is/VBZ certainly/RB not/RB too/RB big/JJ for/IN the/DT Fed/NP to/TO handle/VB ./.

The/DT $/$ 13/CD billion/CD the/DT Fed/NP injected/VBD into/IN the/DT money/NN markets/NNS after/IN the/DT 1987/CD crash/NN is/VBZ more/RBR than/IN enough/JJ to/TO buy/VB all/PDT the/DT stocks/NNS traded/VBN on/IN a/DT typical/JJ day/NN ./.

The/DT Fed/NP 's/POS stock/NN market/NN role/NN ought/MD not/RB to/TO be/VB very/RB ambitious/JJ ./. 
It/PP should/MD seek/VB only/RB to/TO maintain/VB the/DT functioning/NN of/IN markets/NNS --/: not/RB to/TO prop/VB up/RP the/DT Dow/NP Jones/NP or/CC New/NP York/NP Stock/NP Exchange/NP averages/NNS at/IN a/DT particular/JJ level/NN ./. 
The/DT Fed/NP should/MD guard/VB against/IN systemic/JJ risk/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB against/IN the/DT risks/NNS inherent/JJ in/IN individual/JJ stocks/NNS ./. 
It/PP would/MD be/VB inappropriate/JJ for/IN the/DT government/NN or/CC the/DT central/JJ bank/NN to/TO buy/VB or/CC sell/VB IBM/NP or/CC General/NP Motors/NPS shares/NNS ./.

Margins/NNS on/IN the/DT futures/NNS exchanges/NNS typically/RB are/VBP raised/VBN and/CC lowered/VBN according/VBG to/TO market/NN volatility/NN ./.

The/DT Senate/NP Agriculture/NP Committee/NP is/VBZ responding/VBG to/TO trading/NN abuses/NNS in/IN the/DT futures/NNS markets/NNS with/IN a/DT far-reaching/JJ bill/NN that/WDT would/MD become/VB the/DT Futures/NPS Trading/NP Practices/NPS Act/NP of/IN 1989/CD ./. 
The/DT proposed/VBN legislation/NN has/VBZ a/DT laudable/JJ goal/NN :/: to/TO assure/VB the/DT integrity/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NP futures/NNS markets/NNS ./. 
However/RB ,/, as/IN is/VBZ common/JJ with/IN sweeping/JJ legislation/NN ,/, the/DT proposal/NN contains/VBZ many/JJ provisions/NNS that/WDT could/MD destroy/VB important/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT system/NN it/PP sets/VBZ out/RB to/TO preserve/VB ./. 
The/DT complex/JJ bill/NN ,/, introduced/VBN by/IN Sens./NP Patrick/NP Leahy/NP (/( D./NP ,/, Vt./NP )/) ,/, Richard/NP Lugar/NP (/( R./NP ,/, Ind./NP )/) ,/, and/CC Bob/NP Kerrey/NP (/( D./NP ,/, Neb./NP )/) ,/, covers/VBZ a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN provisions/NNS that/WDT would/MD affect/VB the/DT funding/NN and/CC authority/NN of/IN the/DT Commodity/NP Futures/NPS Trading/NP Commission/NP and/CC would/MD profoundly/RB change/VB the/DT way/NN the/DT industry/NN is/VBZ regulated/VBN ./. 
These/DT include/VBP provisions/NNS relating/VBG to/TO the/DT technology/NN and/CC systems/NNS that/WDT must/MD be/VB employed/VBN by/IN exchanges/NNS ,/, oversight/NN and/CC disciplinary/JJ procedures/NNS for/IN exchange/NN trading/NN practices/NNS ,/, the/DT relationship/NN between/IN commodity/NN brokerage/NN firms/NNS and/CC floor/NN traders/NNS ,/, and/CC exchange/NN governance/NN ./. 
The/DT bill/NN also/RB elevates/VBZ even/RB minor/JJ rule/NN infractions/NNS to/TO felonies/NNS and/CC provides/VBZ for/IN recovery/NN of/IN punitive/JJ damages/NNS in/IN civil/JJ lawsuits/NNS and/CC arbitration/NN cases/NNS without/IN any/DT showing/NN of/IN willful/JJ misconduct/NN ./. 
Many/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT bill/NN are/VBP salutary/JJ ,/, providing/VBG appropriate/JJ public/JJ safeguards/NNS that/WDT can/MD and/CC should/MD be/VB instituted/VBN throughout/IN the/DT industry/NN ./. 
Indeed/RB ,/, some/DT of/IN the/DT bill/NN 's/POS requirements/NNS ,/, including/VBG broad/JJ representation/NN on/IN the/DT exchanges/NNS '/POS boards/NNS of/IN directors/NNS and/CC strong/JJ measures/NNS to/TO prevent/VB conflicts/NNS of/IN interest/NN ,/, already/RB have/VBP been/VBN put/VBN in/IN place/NN by/IN the/DT Coffee/NP ,/, Sugar/NP &/CC Cocoa/NP Exchange/NP and/CC other/JJ futures/NNS exchanges/NNS ./. 
Other/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT bill/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, are/VBP either/RB structured/VBN in/IN ways/NNS that/WDT create/VBP unnecessary/JJ burdens/NNS for/IN the/DT industry/NN or/CC actually/RB are/VBP harmful/JJ to/TO the/DT exchanges/NNS ,/, the/DT industry/NN and/CC ultimately/RB the/DT general/JJ public/NN ./. 
One/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS prominent/JJ features/NNS is/VBZ the/DT requirement/NN that/IN in/IN three/CD years/NNS all/DT exchanges/NNS have/VBP in/IN place/NN a/DT system/NN that/WDT records/VBZ all/DT trades/NNS by/IN a/DT source/NN independent/JJ of/IN the/DT executing/VBG broker/NN ./. 
The/DT New/NP York/NP futures/NNS exchanges/NNS have/VBP been/VBN working/VBG together/RB to/TO develop/VB a/DT trade/NN recording/VBG system/NN much/JJ like/IN the/DT one/NN called/VBN for/RB in/IN the/DT bill/NN ./. 
We/PP would/MD be/VB delighted/JJ to/TO have/VB such/JJ a/DT system/NN in/IN place/NN today/NN ./. 
But/CC is/VBZ it/PP realistic/JJ for/IN Congress/NP to/TO mandate/VB by/IN a/DT rigid/JJ deadline/NN a/DT system/NN that/WDT has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB been/VBN subjected/VBN to/TO feasibility/NN studies/NNS ?/. 
What/WP if/IN the/DT system/NN does/VBZ n't/RB work/VB ?/. 
What/WP if/IN the/DT only/JJ system/NN that/WDT does/VBZ work/NN is/VBZ so/RB expensive/JJ that/IN ,/, at/IN best/RBS ,/, only/RB the/DT largest/JJS exchanges/NNS can/MD afford/VB it/PP ?/. 
Cost/NN is/VBZ a/DT key/JJ consideration/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT global/JJ sweep/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ markets/NNS ./. 
The/DT U.S./NP futures/NNS exchanges/NNS compete/VBP world-wide/RB as/RB never/RB before/RB ./. 
Today/NN ,/, trading/NN in/IN almost/RB any/DT commodity/NN can/MD be/VB diverted/VBN from/IN U.S./NP markets/NNS with/IN just/RB a/DT few/JJ strokes/NNS of/IN a/DT keyboard/NN ./. 
All/DT foreign/JJ markets/NNS are/VBP aggressively/RB courting/VBG U.S./NP business/NN ./. 
In/IN fact/NN ,/, several/JJ London/NP markets/NNS already/RB offer/VBP lower/JJR costs/NNS for/IN trading/VBG in/IN the/DT same/JJ or/CC very/RB similar/JJ contracts/NNS ./. 
The/DT U.S./NP exchanges/NNS need/VBP both/DT market/NN integrity/NN and/CC cost-efficiency/NN ;/: long-term/JJ growth/NN depends/VBZ on/IN it/PP ./. 
The/DT Senate/NP bill/NN contains/VBZ many/JJ provisions/NNS that/WDT will/MD increase/VB the/DT costs/NNS of/IN trading/NN ./. 
The/DT most/RBS arbitrary/JJ of/IN these/DT is/VBZ the/DT imposition/NN of/IN ``/`` service/NN fees/NNS ,/, ''/'' which/WDT will/MD directly/RB widen/VB the/DT cost/NN spread/NN between/IN U.S./NP and/CC foreign/JJ markets/NNS ./. 
Other/JJ provisions/NNS have/VBP a/DT more/RBR subtle/JJ ,/, but/CC nonetheless/RB real/JJ and/CC detrimental/JJ effect/NN on/IN the/DT international/JJ position/NN of/IN U.S./NP exchanges/NNS ./. 
These/DT include/VBP the/DT extension/NN of/IN liability/NN into/IN areas/NNS beyond/IN those/DT established/VBN by/IN judicial/JJ precedent/NN and/CC the/DT expansion/NN of/IN liability/NN to/TO include/VB punitive/JJ damages/NNS ./. 
In/IN addition/NN to/TO increasing/VBG costs/NNS as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN greater/JJR financial/JJ exposure/NN for/IN members/NNS ,/, these/DT measures/NNS could/MD have/VB other/JJ ,/, far-reaching/JJ repercussions/NNS ./. 
One/CD section/NN of/IN the/DT bill/NN would/MD make/VB all/DT commodity/NN brokerage/NN firms/NNS and/CC floor/NN brokers/NNS liable/JJ for/IN damages/NNS without/IN willful/JJ misconduct/NN ./. 
Nowhere/RB in/IN the/DT federal/JJ securities/NNS law/NN is/VBZ simple/JJ negligence/NN or/CC inadvertent/JJ action/NN a/DT source/NN of/IN liability/NN under/IN similar/JJ circumstances/NNS ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ only/RB logical/JJ to/TO assume/VB that/IN the/DT enactment/NN of/IN this/DT provision/NN will/MD lead/VB to/TO increased/VBN litigation/NN ./. 
In/IN an/DT already/RB low-profitmargin/NN business/NN ,/, commodity/NN brokerage/NN firms/NNS may/MD well/RB decide/VB to/TO eliminate/VB the/DT risk/NN and/CC expense/NN of/IN dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT retail/JJ public/NN ,/, depriving/VBG the/DT private/JJ individual/NN of/IN access/NN to/TO the/DT markets/NNS ./. 
Another/DT measure/NN makes/VBZ commodity/NN brokerage/NN firms/NNS liable/JJ for/IN violations/NNS committed/VBN by/IN independent/JJ floor/NN brokers/NNS who/WP execute/VBP trades/NNS for/IN them/PP ./. 
This/DT untried/JJ concept/NN would/MD expose/VB these/DT firms/NNS to/TO potentially/RB astronomical/JJ punitive/JJ damages/NNS ./. 
Faced/VBN with/IN the/DT virtually/RB impossible/JJ task/NN of/IN supervising/VBG the/DT execution/NN of/IN each/DT trade/NN ,/, many/JJ commodity/NN brokerage/NN firms/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO stop/VB doing/VBG business/NN with/IN independents/NNS and/CC instead/RB hire/VB their/PP$ own/JJ salaried/JJ floor/NN brokers/NNS ./. 
This/DT would/MD force/VB out/IN of/IN business/NN many/JJ of/IN the/DT individuals/NNS and/CC small/JJ firms/NNS that/WDT function/VBP as/IN floor/NN brokers/NNS ./. 
A/DT consequence/NN of/IN their/PP$ departure/NN could/MD be/VB a/DT serious/JJ diminution/NN of/IN market/NN liquidity/NN ./. 
Finally/RB ,/, under/IN the/DT bill/NN ,/, a/DT number/NN of/IN legitimate/JJ ,/, longstanding/JJ business/NN practices/NNS would/MD be/VB arbitrarily/RB banned/VBN ,/, unless/IN the/DT CFTC/NP were/VBD to/TO take/VB specific/JJ and/CC timely/JJ action/NN to/TO permit/VB them/PP to/TO continue/VB ./. 
In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, regulation/NN will/MD occur/VB through/IN inaction/NN and/CC happenstance/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN through/IN a/DT normal/JJ deliberative/JJ procedure/NN ./. 
The/DT affected/JJ practices/NNS include/VBP the/DT placing/NN of/IN oral/JJ orders/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT way/NN most/RBS public/JJ customer/NN orders/NNS are/VBP placed/VBN ,/, and/CC trading/NN between/IN affiliated/JJ brokers/NNS ,/, even/RB though/IN in/IN some/DT cases/NNS trading/VBG with/IN affiliates/NNS may/MD be/VB the/DT only/JJ way/NN to/TO obtain/VB the/DT best/JJS execution/NN for/IN a/DT client/NN ./. 
Also/RB precluded/JJ would/MD be/VB dual/JJ trading/NN ,/, whereby/WRB a/DT broker/NN trades/VBZ for/IN customers/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN his/PP$ own/JJ account/NN ,/, a/DT practice/NN that/WDT provides/VBZ needed/JJ liquidity/NN to/TO the/DT markets/NNS ./. 
All/DT U.S./NP futures/NNS exchanges/NNS agree/VBP that/IN these/DT and/CC other/JJ trading/NN practices/NNS require/VBP proper/JJ regulation/NN and/CC supervision/NN ./. 
Nonetheless/RB ,/, each/DT has/VBZ too/RB much/RB potential/JJ value/NN to/TO the/DT system/NN to/TO be/VB banned/VBN by/IN legislative/JJ fiat/NN before/IN the/DT CFTC/NP carefully/RB considers/VBZ all/PDT the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN a/DT ban/NN and/CC what/WP the/DT regulatory/JJ alternatives/NNS are/VBP ./.

So/IN far/RB no/DT one/NN has/VBZ suggested/VBN putting/VBG the/DT comptroller/NN back/RB on/IN the/DT board/NN ./.

Mr./NP Dorgen/NP has/VBZ changed/VBN tactics/NNS ,/, dropping/VBG the/DT seat-for-the-secretary/JJ idea/NN ./.

After/IN the/DT October/NP 1987/CD market/NN crash/NN ,/, Mr./NP Brady/NP as/IN a/DT private/JJ citizen/NN headed/VBD a/DT presidential/JJ commission/NN that/WDT tried/VBD to/TO decide/VB what/WP went/VBD wrong/JJ and/CC what/WP should/MD be/VB done/VBN about/IN it/PP ./.

This/DT recommendation/NN might/MD have/VB encouraged/VBN a/DT turf-hungry/JJ bureaucrat/NN to/TO try/VB to/TO expand/VB his/PP$ power/NN ,/, but/CC so/RB far/JJ Federal/NP Reserve/NP Chairman/NP Alan/NP Greenspan/NP has/VBZ n't/RB made/VBN a/DT pitch/NN for/IN the/DT job/NN ./. 
The/DT Fed/NP has/VBZ plenty/NN of/IN responsibilities/NNS in/IN times/NNS of/IN market/NN turmoil/NN and/CC in/IN 1987/CD and/CC again/RB in/IN 1989/CD it/PP appears/VBZ to/TO have/VB handled/VBN them/PP well/RB ./.

In/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS ,/, moreover/RB ,/, Mr./NP Brady/NP has/VBZ joined/VBN other/JJ administration/NN officials/NNS in/IN trying/VBG to/TO urge/VB the/DT Fed/NP toward/IN lower/JJR interest/NN rates/NNS ./. 
The/DT urging/VBG admittedly/RB has/VBZ been/VBN gentle/JJ ./. 
In/IN an/DT interview/NN with/IN the/DT Washington/NP Post/NP in/IN early/JJ October/NP ,/, the/DT secretary/NN said/VBD the/DT Fed/NP may/MD be/VB slightly/RB more/RBR interested/JJ in/IN curbing/VBG inflation/NN than/IN the/DT administration/NN is/VBZ ,/, while/IN the/DT administration/NN may/MD put/VB slightly/RB more/JJR emphasis/NN on/IN spurring/VBG economic/JJ growth/NN ./. 
At/IN least/JJS some/DT economists/NNS ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, would/MD argue/VB that/IN inflation/NN deserves/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN emphasis/NN ./. 
Earlier/RBR this/DT month/NN the/DT St./NP Louis/NP Fed/NP held/VBD a/DT conference/NN to/TO assess/VB the/DT system/NN 's/POS first/JJ 75/CD years/NNS ./. 
Allan/NP Meltzer/NP ,/, a/DT Carnegie-Mellon/NP University/NP economist/NN ,/, noted/VBD that/IN the/DT Fed/NP 's/POS record/NN included/VBD the/DT longest/JJS ,/, most/RBS sustained/VBN ,/, peacetime/NN inflation/NN in/IN our/PP$ history/NN ,/, dating/VBG from/IN either/RB 1966/CD or/CC 1967/CD to/TO 1989/CD ./. 
The/DT inflation-growth/NN argument/NN is/VBZ an/DT old/JJ one/CD ,/, but/CC Mr./NP Brady/NP ,/, on/IN the/DT board/NN or/CC off/IN ,/, is/VBZ surely/RB trying/VBG to/TO influence/VB Fed/NP policy/NN ./. 
Equally/RB importantly/RB ,/, the/DT treasury/NN secretary/NN has/VBZ spearheaded/VBN the/DT administration/NN effort/NN to/TO bring/VB the/DT U.S./NP dollar/NN down/IN by/IN shopping/VBG avidly/RB for/IN West/JJ German/JJ marks/NNS and/CC Japanese/JJ yen/NNS ./. 
The/DT treasury/NN can/MD do/VB something/NN on/IN its/PP$ own/JJ ,/, but/CC to/TO have/VB any/DT hope/NN of/IN success/NN it/PP needs/VBZ help/NN from/IN the/DT Fed/NP ./. 
The/DT central/JJ bank/NN has/VBZ been/VBN helping/VBG ,/, but/CC apparently/RB not/RB especially/RB eagerly/RB ./. 
The/DT Fed/NP has/VBZ been/VBN intervening/VBG in/IN foreign/JJ currency/NN markets/NNS ,/, all/RB right/JJ ,/, but/CC through/IN August/NP ,/, at/IN least/JJS ,/, it/PP appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB ``/`` sterilizing/VBG ''/'' the/DT intervention/NN ./. 
In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, it/PP was/VBD offsetting/VBG purchases/NNS of/IN marks/NNS and/CC yen/NN by/IN buying/VBG dollars/NNS in/IN the/DT domestic/JJ money/NN market/NN ./. 
Now/RB ,/, sterilized/VBN intervention/NN may/MD have/VB some/DT effect/NN ./. 
When/WRB traders/NNS see/VBP the/DT Fed/NP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT exchange/NN market/NN it/PP may/MD make/VB them/PP tread/VB a/DT little/JJ carefully/RB ,/, for/IN fear/NN of/IN what/WP the/DT central/JJ bank/NN may/MD do/VB ./. 
But/CC it/PP 's/VBZ generally/RB accepted/VBN that/IN sterilized/VBN intervention/NN has/VBZ little/RB or/CC no/DT lasting/JJ impact/NN on/IN currency/NN values/NNS ./. 
After/IN August/NP the/DT Fed/NP may/MD have/VB stopped/VBN sterilizing/VBG ,/, but/CC it/PP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO see/VB much/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT dollar/NN ./. 
The/DT dollar/NN is/VBZ still/RB highly/RB volatile/JJ ./. 
The/DT Fed/NP has/VBZ let/VBN interest/NN rates/NNS slip/VBP slightly/RB ,/, but/CC whether/IN the/DT main/JJ reason/NN was/VBD dollar/NN intervention/NN ,/, the/DT gloomy/JJ reports/NNS on/IN manufacturing/VBG employment/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT Friday/NP 13/CD market/NN drop/NN ,/, only/RB Mr./NP Greenspan/NP and/CC his/PP$ associates/NNS know/VBP ./. 
Earlier/RBR this/DT year/NN ,/, Martin/NP Feldstein/NP ,/, president/NN of/IN the/DT National/NP Bureau/NP of/IN Economic/NP Research/NP ,/, argued/VBD forcefully/RB that/IN a/DT government/NN that/WDT wants/VBZ steady/JJ ,/, stable/JJ exchange/NN rates/NNS might/MD try/VB some/DT steady/JJ stable/JJ economic/JJ policies/NNS ./. 
Trying/VBG to/TO manage/VB exchange/NN rates/NNS to/TO some/DT desired/VBN level/NN ,/, he/PP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` would/MD mean/VB diverting/VBG monetary/JJ and/CC fiscal/JJ policies/NNS from/IN their/PP$ customary/JJ roles/NNS and/CC thereby/RB risking/VBG excessive/JJ inflation/NN and/CC unemployment/NN and/CC inadequate/JJ capital/NN formation/NN ./. 
''/'' The/DT more/RBR we/PP think/VBP about/IN it/PP ,/, the/DT more/RBR we/PP suspect/VBP Mr./NP Brady/NP does/VBZ indeed/RB have/VB enough/JJ power/NN where/WRB he/PP already/RB is/VBZ ./. 
This/DT has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT week/NN of/IN stunning/JJ events/NNS behind/IN what/WP was/VBD once/RB called/VBN the/DT Iron/NP Curtain/NP and/CC interesting/JJ shifts/NNS in/IN official/JJ American/JJ policy/NN toward/IN Moscow/NP ./.

It/PP has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN so/RB ./. 
In/IN the/DT 1920s/CD ,/, a/DT young/JJ schoolteacher/NN ,/, John/NP T./NP Scopes/NP ,/, volunteered/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT guinea/NN pig/NN in/IN a/DT test/NN case/NN sponsored/VBN by/IN the/DT American/NP Civil/NP Liberties/NP Union/NP to/TO challenge/VB a/DT ban/NN on/IN the/DT teaching/NN of/IN evolution/NN imposed/VBN by/IN the/DT Tennessee/NP Legislature/NP ./.

And/CC so/IN it/PP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB with/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN Elizabeth/NP Morgan/NP ,/, the/DT Washington/NP ,/, D.C./NP ,/, plastic/NN surgeon/NN jailed/VBN in/IN a/DT child/NN custody/NN case/NN for/IN refusing/VBG to/TO reveal/VB the/DT whereabouts/NN of/IN her/PP$ daughter/NN ./.

To/TO the/DT rest/NN of/IN us/PP ,/, the/DT case/NN is/VBZ a/DT puzzle/NN ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ what/WP lawyers/NNS call/VBP ``/`` fact/NN intensive/JJ ./. 
''/'' It/PP presents/VBZ no/DT great/JJ issue/NN of/IN legal/JJ principle/NN ,/, no/DT overriding/VBG question/NN of/IN family/NN law/NN or/CC the/DT law/NN of/IN contempt/NN ./. 
Instead/RB ,/, it/PP turns/VBZ on/IN the/DT disputed/VBN and/CC elusive/JJ facts/NNS of/IN ``/`` who/WP did/VBD what/WP to/TO whom/WP ./. 
''/'' It/PP is/VBZ difficult/JJ ,/, if/IN not/RB impossible/JJ ,/, for/IN anyone/NN who/WP has/VBZ not/RB pored/VBN over/IN the/DT thousands/NNS of/IN pages/NNS of/IN court/NN pleadings/NNS and/CC transcripts/NNS to/TO have/VB a/DT worthwhile/JJ opinion/NN on/IN the/DT underlying/VBG merits/NNS of/IN the/DT controversy/NN ./. 
Certainly/RB I/PP do/VBP not/RB ./. 
So/IN we/PP must/MD look/VB elsewhere/RB for/IN an/DT explanation/NN of/IN the/DT unusual/JJ power/NN this/DT case/NN has/VBZ exerted/VBN over/IN the/DT minds/NNS of/IN many/JJ ,/, not/RB just/RB in/IN Washington/NP but/CC elsewhere/RB in/IN the/DT country/NN and/CC even/RB the/DT world/NN ./. 
I/PP suggest/VBP that/IN three/CD themes/NNS have/VBP come/VBN together/RB in/IN the/DT strange/JJ case/NN of/IN Dr./NP Morgan/NP ./. 
The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ that/IN it/PP represents/VBZ an/DT intense/JJ battle/NN in/IN what/WP James/NP Thurber/NP used/VBD to/TO caricature/VB as/IN ``/`` the/DT war/NN between/IN the/DT sexes/NNS ./. 
''/'' But/CC although/IN Thurber/NP did/VBD so/RB gently/RB and/CC lightheartedly/RB ,/, many/JJ of/IN Dr./NP Morgan/NP 's/POS supporters/NNS have/VBP taken/VBN Thurber/NP 's/POS memorable/JJ title/NN ``/`` The/NP Male/NP Animal/NP ''/'' quite/RB literally/RB ./. 
The/DT vehemence/NN of/IN the/DT emotions/NNS aroused/VBN by/IN the/DT case/NN testifies/VBZ to/TO its/PP$ symbolic/JJ importance/NN in/IN the/DT war/NN that/IN Thurber/NP accepted/VBD as/IN an/DT eternal/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT human/JJ condition/NN ./. 
A/DT second/JJ theme/NN is/VBZ the/DT undercurrent/NN of/IN social/JJ class/NN and/CC race/NN in/IN the/DT public/JJ reaction/NN to/TO the/DT Morgan/NP case/NN ./. 
Dr./NP Morgan/NP is/VBZ a/DT highly/RB educated/VBN white/JJ professional/NN who/WP attended/VBD some/DT of/IN the/DT ``/`` best/JJS ''/'' schools/NNS ./. 
As/IN members/NNS of/IN the/DT Black/NP Caucus/NP in/IN Congress/NP asked/VBD during/IN the/DT debate/NN on/IN the/DT legislation/NN that/WDT freed/VBD Dr./NP Morgan/NP ,/, does/VBZ anyone/NN seriously/RB believe/VB that/IN if/IN she/PP were/VBD an/DT uneducated/JJ ,/, black/JJ ,/, working-class/JJ woman/NN ,/, Congress/NP would/MD have/VB rushed/VBN to/TO pass/VB a/DT private/JJ relief/NN bill/NN freeing/VBG her/PP ?/. 
Or/CC that/IN the/DT president/NN would/MD have/VB hurried/VBN to/TO sign/VB the/DT bill/NN ``/`` out/IN of/IN compassion/NN for/IN her/PP$ plight/NN ''/'' ?/. 
To/TO ask/VB those/DT questions/NNS is/VBZ to/TO answer/VB them/PP ./. 
Finally/RB ,/, the/DT case/NN of/IN Dr./NP Morgan/NP gave/VBD Congress/NP an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO act/VB with/IN unaccustomed/JJ decisiveness/NN and/CC to/TO engage/VB in/IN one/CD of/IN its/PP$ favorite/JJ pastimes/NNS --/: bashing/VBG the/DT District/NP of/IN Columbia/NP government/NN ./. 
The/DT local/JJ government/NN is/VBZ discredited/VBN in/IN the/DT eyes/NNS of/IN many/JJ residents/NNS for/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN reasons/NNS ,/, and/CC congressmen/NNS read/VBP the/DT same/JJ newspapers/NNS and/CC watch/VBP the/DT same/JJ TV/NN newscasts/NNS as/IN other/JJ people/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN do/VBP ./. 
Bashing/VBG the/DT D.C./NP government/NN is/VBZ risk-free/JJ for/IN members/NNS of/IN Congress/NP ,/, who/WP do/VBP not/RB have/VB to/TO answer/VB to/TO their/PP$ own/JJ constituents/NNS for/IN it/PP ./. 
Congress/NP is/VBZ paralyzed/VBN from/IN acting/VBG on/IN such/JJ great/JJ issues/NNS of/IN the/DT day/NN as/IN the/DT federal/JJ budget/NN deficit/NN ./. 
Yet/RB a/DT bill/NN tailored/VBN to/TO the/DT interests/NNS of/IN a/DT single/JJ individual/NN passed/VBD Congress/NP with/IN almost/RB unimaginable/JJ speed/NN ,/, before/IN the/DT judicial/JJ process/NN had/VBD run/VBN its/PP$ course/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, indeed/RB ,/, while/IN the/DT Morgan/NP case/NN was/VBD awaiting/VBG a/DT ruling/NN by/IN the/DT appellate/JJ court/NN ./. 
The/DT Morgan/NP case/NN thus/RB tells/VBZ us/PP much/RB more/RBR about/IN the/DT current/JJ state/NN of/IN sex/NN ,/, class/NN ,/, race/NN and/CC politics/NNS in/IN our/PP$ society/NN than/IN it/PP does/VBZ about/IN the/DT facts/NNS of/IN Dr./NP Morgan/NP 's/POS particular/JJ situation/NN ./. 
It/PP may/MD stand/VB as/IN a/DT metaphor/NN for/IN how/WRB wide/JJ and/CC deep/JJ the/DT divisions/NNS in/IN that/DT society/NN continue/VBP to/TO be/VB however/RB we/PP try/VBP to/TO deny/VB their/PP$ existence/NN ./.
