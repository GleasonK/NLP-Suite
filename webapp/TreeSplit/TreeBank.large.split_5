In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, the/DT two/CD men/NNS ,/, so/RB different/JJ in/IN temperament/NN ,/, converged/VBD in/IN the/DT invention/NN of/IN the/DT radical/JJ new/JJ style/NN that/WDT came/VBD to/TO be/VB known/VBN as/IN cubism/NN ./.

The/DT first/JJ thing/NN to/TO be/VB said/VBN about/IN this/DT exhibition/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS beautiful/JJ and/CC moving/VBG shows/VBZ the/DT museum/NN has/VBZ mounted/VBN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ not/RB only/RB because/IN it/PP includes/VBZ some/DT of/IN the/DT most/RBS beautiful/JJ and/CC moving/JJ art/NN created/VBN in/IN our/PP$ century/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB because/IN that/DT art/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN with/IN a/DT rare/JJ sensitivity/NN to/TO its/PP$ special/JJ qualities/NNS ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT vast/JJ show/NN ,/, comprising/VBG nearly/RB 400/CD works/NNS ,/, many/JJ of/IN them/PP cryptic/JJ and/CC confined/VBN to/TO a/DT single/JJ color/NN ,/, but/CC it/PP is/VBZ constantly/RB exciting/JJ as/RB well/RB as/IN challenging/JJ ./. 
As/IN you/PP go/VBP through/IN this/DT show/NN ,/, you/PP learn/VBP a/DT good/JJ deal/NN about/IN Picasso/NP ,/, Braque/NP and/CC cubism/NN ./. 
But/CC the/DT classroom/NN element/NN here/RB is/VBZ painless/JJ ,/, and/CC such/JJ potentially/RB pedantic/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT overall/JJ arrangement/NN as/IN its/PP$ rigorously/RB chronological/JJ order/NN and/CC its/PP$ lecturing/NN wall/NN panels/NNS ,/, happily/RB melt/VBP ,/, as/IN it/PP were/VBD ,/, into/IN the/DT intensity/NN of/IN the/DT experience/NN of/IN seeing/VBG the/DT art/NN ./. 
The/DT exhibition/NN starts/VBZ on/IN the/DT ground-floor/JJ galleries/NNS with/IN Picasso/NP 's/POS violently/RB fractured/VBN ``/`` Demoiselles/NP d'Avignon/NP ''/'' of/IN 1907/CD ,/, the/DT brothel/NN scene/NN that/WDT generally/RB is/VBZ regarded/VBN as/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT cubist/JJ adventure/NN ./. 
Subsequent/JJ galleries/NNS set/VBP forth/RB the/DT pictorial/JJ dialogue/NN that/IN this/DT large/JJ painting/NN provoked/VBD between/IN Picasso/NP and/CC Braque/NP ,/, who/WP when/WRB he/PP first/RB saw/VBD it/PP said/VBD he/PP felt/VBD as/IN if/IN he/PP had/VBD been/VBN asked/VBN to/TO ``/`` eat/VB rope/NN or/CC drink/VB gasoline/NN ./. 
''/'' Braque/NP 's/POS own/JJ work/NN after/IN that/DT encounter/NN was/VBD radically/RB transformed/VBN ,/, as/IN is/VBZ evident/JJ in/IN his/PP$ ``/`` Large/NP Nude/NP ''/'' of/IN 1908/CD ,/, an/DT important/JJ but/CC rarely/RB exhibited/VBN picture/NN from/IN a/DT French/JJ private/JJ collection/NN ./. 
This/DT show/NN is/VBZ rich/JJ in/IN rarely/RB seen/VBN pictures/NNS ./. 
Just/RB a/DT little/RB farther/RB on/IN is/VBZ Picasso/NP 's/POS ``/`` Three/NP Women/NPS ''/'' of/IN 1908/CD ,/, a/DT powerful/JJ canvas/NN nearly/RB as/RB large/JJ as/IN the/DT more/RBR famous/JJ ``/`` Demoiselles/NP ./. 
''/'' Lent/VBN by/IN the/DT Hermitage/NP in/IN Leningrad/NP ,/, it/PP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN many/JJ here/RB from/IN Soviet/JJ museums/NNS turning/VBG generous/JJ under/IN perestroika/FW ./. 
Numerous/JJ other/JJ loans/NNS from/IN abroad/RB and/CC from/IN private/JJ collections/NNS make/VBP this/DT a/DT unique/JJ opportunity/NN to/TO compare/VB at/IN first/JJ hand/NN works/NNS that/WDT may/MD never/RB again/RB be/VB seen/VBN together/RB ./. 
In/IN the/DT galleries/NNS dedicated/VBN to/TO the/DT works/NNS done/VBN between/IN 1909/CD and/CC 1911/CD ,/, the/DT pictures/NNS leave/VBP the/DT imitation/NN of/IN objective/JJ reality/NN further/RB and/CC further/RB behind/IN ,/, as/IN their/PP$ palette/NN turns/VBZ more/RBR resolutely/RB monochromatic/JJ --/: although/IN every/DT now/RB and/CC then/RB Braque/NP seems/VBZ unable/JJ to/TO restrain/VB himself/PP from/IN adding/VBG a/DT few/JJ vivid/JJ notes/NNS of/IN color/NN ./. 
The/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT dialogue/NN between/IN Picasso/NP and/CC Braque/NP also/RB becomes/VBZ clearer/JJR as/IN the/DT exhibition/NN unfolds/VBZ ,/, with/IN some/DT wonderfully/RB informative/JJ juxtapositions/NNS ./. 
The/DT pairing/NN of/IN Braque/NP 's/POS luminously/RB transparent/JJ ``/`` Harbor/NP in/IN Normandy/NP ''/'' with/IN Picasso/NP 's/POS blocky/JJ ,/, stonelike/JJ ``/`` Landscape/NP With/NP Bridge/NP ,/, ''/'' both/DT from/IN the/DT spring/NN of/IN 1909/CD ,/, show/VBP us/PP how/WRB different/JJ were/VBD the/DT two/CD men/NNS 's/POS artistic/JJ temperaments/NNS ./. 
While/IN Braque/NP was/VBD a/DT more/RBR lyrical/JJ painter/NN who/WP tended/VBD to/TO emphasize/VB light/NN and/CC space/NN ,/, Picasso/NP was/VBD more/RBR bound/VBN to/TO solid/JJ objects/NNS and/CC more/RBR concerned/VBN with/IN the/DT sculptural/JJ logic/NN of/IN his/PP$ forms/NNS ./. 
Similarly/RB ,/, the/DT juxtaposition/NN of/IN two/CD or/CC more/JJR works/NNS by/IN the/DT same/JJ artist/NN often/RB reveals/VBZ a/DT lot/NN about/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN his/PP$ thinking/NN at/IN a/DT given/VBN time/NN ./. 
The/DT pairing/NN of/IN Picasso/NP 's/POS still/RB somewhat/RB sculptural/JJ ``/`` Woman/NP With/NP a/DT Mandolin/NP (/( Fanny/NP Tellier/NP )/) ,/, ''/'' done/VBN in/IN the/DT spring/NN of/IN 1910/CD ,/, with/IN his/PP$ ``/`` Guitarist/NP ,/, ''/'' which/WDT was/VBD painted/VBN just/RB a/DT few/JJ months/NNS later/RB ,/, provides/VBZ an/DT eloquent/JJ insight/NN into/IN the/DT way/NN Picasso/NP worked/VBD toward/IN greater/JJR abstraction/NN at/IN that/DT time/NN ./. 
This/DT process/NN reaches/VBZ a/DT culmination/NN in/IN the/DT so-called/JJ analytical/JJ cubist/JJ paintings/NNS of/IN 1910-12/CD ./. 
In/IN the/DT galleries/NNS devoted/VBN to/TO them/PP ,/, the/DT work/NN virtually/RB engulfs/VBZ you/PP with/IN its/PP$ mystical/JJ atmosphere/NN ./. 
In/IN picture/NN after/IN picture/NN the/DT world/NN is/VBZ translated/VBN into/IN complex/JJ ensembles/NNS of/IN fragmentary/JJ ,/, earth-colored/JJ signs/NNS ;/: individual/JJ objects/NNS are/VBP barely/RB recognizable/JJ ./. 
But/CC here/RB again/RB ,/, Picasso/NP held/VBD onto/IN remnants/NNS of/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN more/RBR strongly/RB than/IN did/VBD Braque/NP ./. 
In/IN his/PP$ 1910/CD portrait/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN dealer/NN Ambroise/NP Vollard/NP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, although/IN the/DT space/NN in/IN much/JJ of/IN the/DT picture/NN is/VBZ fragmented/VBN almost/RB to/TO the/DT point/NN of/IN abstraction/NN ,/, the/DT subject/NN 's/POS face/NN stands/VBZ out/IN ,/, clearly/RB recognizable/JJ as/IN a/DT vivid/JJ portrait/NN ./. 
From/IN this/DT pinnacle/NN ,/, the/DT show/NN continues/VBZ with/IN what/WP might/MD have/VB made/VBN a/DT fine/JJ exhibition/NN all/DT by/IN itself/PP devoted/VBN to/TO Braque/NP and/CC Picasso/NP 's/POS invention/NN of/IN ``/`` constructed/VBN ''/'' sculpture/NN and/CC collage/NN ./. 
It/PP was/VBD Braque/NP ,/, as/IN this/DT show/NN demonstrates/VBZ ,/, who/WP apparently/RB built/VBD the/DT first/JJ cardboard/NN and/CC wood/NN reliefs/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD constructed/VBN --/: cut/VBN out/IN and/CC assembled/VBN --/: rather/RB than/IN modeled/VBN or/CC carved/VBN like/IN traditional/JJ sculpture/NN ./. 
But/CC as/IN is/VBZ evident/JJ in/IN the/DT earlier/JJR part/NN of/IN the/DT show/NN ,/, although/IN it/PP was/VBD Braque/NP who/WP first/RB made/VBD certain/JJ innovations/NNS ,/, it/PP was/VBD Picasso/NP who/WP frequently/RB made/VBD the/DT most/JJS of/IN them/PP ./. 
This/DT is/VBZ apparent/JJ in/IN the/DT rich/JJ selection/NN of/IN constructed/VBN sculptures/NNS and/CC pasted/VBN paper/NN compositions/NNS on/IN view/NN here/RB ./. 
The/DT virtuosity/NN ,/, variety/NN --/: and/CC wittiness/NN --/: of/IN Picasso/NP 's/POS work/NN in/IN these/DT mediums/NNS are/VBP quite/RB astounding/JJ ./. 
The/DT selection/NN of/IN works/NNS also/RB is/VBZ excellent/JJ ,/, including/VBG as/IN it/PP does/VBZ the/DT seminal/JJ ``/`` Still/NP Life/NP With/NP Chair/NP Caning/NP ''/'' of/IN May/NP 1912/CD ,/, in/IN which/WDT Picasso/NP first/RB mixed/VBD the/DT languages/NNS of/IN painting/NN and/CC pasting/NN ,/, and/CC ``/`` Guitar/NP ,/, Sheet/NP Music/NP ,/, and/CC Glass/NP ,/, ''/'' another/DT early/JJ collage/NN that/WDT resonantly/RB combines/VBZ a/DT newspaper/NN clipping/NN with/IN other/JJ pasted-in/JJ fragments/NNS from/IN the/DT worlds/NNS of/IN commerce/NN and/CC the/DT imagination/NN ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ at/IN this/DT point/NN that/IN you/PP also/RB reach/VBP the/DT first/JJ and/CC only/RB place/NN to/TO sit/VB in/IN the/DT whole/JJ show/NN ./.

In/IN 1987/CD ,/, in/IN the/DT wake/NN of/IN the/DT Rios/NP case/NN ,/, Victoria/NP passed/VBD the/DT first/JJ legislation/NN specifically/RB drafted/VBD to/TO control/VB IVF/NP programs/NNS ./. 
Under/IN the/DT Infertility/NP (/( Medical/NP Procedures/NPS )/) Act/NP ,/, IVF/NP centers/NNS are/VBP required/VBN to/TO keep/VB a/DT register/NN of/IN information/NN including/VBG ``/`` particulars/NNS of/IN any/DT abnormality/NN identified/VBN at/IN or/CC about/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN birth/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT parents/NNS of/IN the/DT child/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT donors/NNS of/IN gametes/NNS used/VBN in/IN the/DT procedures/NNS ./.

IVF/NP clinics/NNS are/VBP also/RB required/VBN to/TO keep/VB confidential/JJ records/NNS about/IN donors/NNS and/CC their/PP$ gametes/NNS so/IN that/IN people/NNS who/WP develop/VBP from/IN donated/VBN embryos/NNS can/MD have/VB access/NN to/TO information/NN about/IN their/PP$ biological/JJ origins/NNS ./. 
Such/JJ records/NNS theoretically/RB could/MD also/RB be/VB used/VBN in/IN the/DT future/NN to/TO prevent/VB IVF/NP incest/NN and/CC unwitting/JJ marriages/NNS or/CC sexual/JJ relationships/NNS between/IN genetic/JJ relatives/NNS ./. 
The/DT law/NN also/RB requires/VBZ IVF/NP centers/NNS to/TO monitor/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN genetic/JJ material/NN supplied/VBN by/IN donors/NNS ./. 
This/DT requirement/NN is/VBZ aimed/VBN at/IN reducing/VBG the/DT chance/NN of/IN an/DT infectious/JJ or/CC genetic/JJ disease/NN being/VBG passed/VBD on/IN to/TO a/DT child/NN ./. 
Some/DT would-be/JJ donors/NNS are/VBP rejected/VBN ./. 
In/IN a/DT bid/NN to/TO prevent/VB the/DT stockpiling/NN and/CC deterioration/NN of/IN frozen/VBN embryos/NNS ,/, IVF/NP centers/NNS ,/, encouraged/VBN by/IN a/DT law/NN that/WDT requires/VBZ them/PP to/TO review/VB the/DT status/NN of/IN frozen/VBN embryos/NNS after/IN five/CD years/NNS ,/, have/VBP put/VBN a/DT five-year/JJ limit/NN on/IN the/DT period/NN of/IN time/NN embryos/NNS can/MD be/VB kept/VBN in/IN storage/NN ./. 
This/DT prevents/VBZ the/DT implantation/NN of/IN embryos/NNS years/NNS after/IN they/PP were/VBD frozen/VBN ,/, avoiding/VBG situations/NNS in/IN which/WDT a/DT woman/NN formed/VBN from/IN an/DT IVF/NP program/NN could/MD later/RB be/VB implanted/VBN with/IN ,/, say/VB ,/, her/PP$ own/JJ brother/NN or/CC sister/NN embryo/NN ./. 
Another/DT aim/NN of/IN the/DT law/NN is/VBZ to/TO limit/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN embryos/NNS that/WDT can/MD be/VB created/VBN by/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN a/DT couple/NN uses/VBZ IVF/NP only/RB as/IN a/DT last/JJ resort/NN ./.

The/DT consent/NN forms/NNS are/VBP intended/VBN to/TO cover/VB a/DT range/NN of/IN situations/NNS in/IN which/WDT a/DT couple/NN may/MD donate/VB an/DT embryo/NN to/TO a/DT second/JJ couple/NN ./. 
This/DT could/MD happen/VB if/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, a/DT woman/NN becomes/VBZ pregnant/JJ and/CC she/PP and/CC her/PP husband/NN do/VBP n't/RB need/VB the/DT spare/JJ embryos/NNS ,/, or/CC if/IN there/EX is/VBZ an/DT illness/NN ,/, accident/NN or/CC death/NN and/CC a/DT couple/NN can/MD no/RB longer/RB use/VB their/PP$ embryos/NNS ./. 
In/IN cases/NNS in/IN which/WDT one/CD of/IN the/DT couple/NN withdraws/VBZ consent/NN --/: as/IN in/IN the/DT Davis/NP case/NN in/IN the/DT U.S./NP --/: the/DT matter/NN is/VBZ referred/VBN to/TO the/DT state/NN health/NN minister/NN ,/, who/WP assumes/VBZ guardianship/NN of/IN the/DT embryos/NNS on/IN behalf/NN of/IN the/DT state/NN government/NN ./.

Under/IN Victoria/NP 's/POS law/NN ,/, the/DT couple/NN whose/WP$ gametes/NNS were/VBD used/VBN to/TO build/VB the/DT embryo/NN surrender/VBP all/DT rights/NNS to/TO and/CC responsibilities/NNS for/IN any/DT resulting/VBG child/NN ./. 
The/DT recipients/NNS of/IN the/DT donated/VBN embryo/NN become/VBP the/DT legal/JJ parents/NNS ./.

Also/RB ,/, traders/NNS said/VBD reports/NNS that/IN the/DT Fed/NP intervened/VBD in/IN the/DT Tokyo/NP market/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN since/IN the/DT Plaza/NP Accord/NP shocked/VBD Japanese/JJ institutional/JJ investors/NNS and/CC dealers/NNS there/RB ./.

``/`` Our/PP$ Tokyo/NP people/NNS are/VBP surprised/JJ because/IN the/DT Fed/NP intervened/VBD in/IN Tokyo/NP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Yoichi/NP Sakaguchi/NP ,/, chief/JJ trader/NN at/IN Sanwa/NP Bank/NP in/IN New/NP York/NP ./. 
``/`` That/DT was/VBD a/DT key/JJ surprise/NN ./. 
''/'' As/IN is/VBZ its/PP$ policy/NN ,/, the/DT Fed/NP declined/VBD to/TO comment/VB on/IN its/PP$ currency/NN actions/NNS ./. 
With/IN yesterday/NN 's/POS sales/NNS ,/, the/DT dollar/NN is/VBZ near/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT trading/NN band/NN that/IN many/JJ traders/NNS and/CC economists/NNS say/VBP the/DT G-7/NN strived/VBD to/TO keep/VB it/PP in/RP since/IN early/JJ 1987/CD ./.

Indeed/RB ,/, the/DT dollar/NN has/VBZ traded/VBN above/IN the/DT upper/JJ limits/NNS for/IN much/JJ of/IN this/DT year/NN ./. 
Along/IN with/IN the/DT intervention/NN ,/, Bundesbank/NP President/NP Karl/NP Otto/NP Poehl/NP said/VBD the/DT dollar/NN 's/POS fall/NN corresponded/VBD with/IN the/DT G-7/NN communique/NN ./.

Surprisingly/RB ,/, dealers/NNS said/VBD that/IN with/IN the/DT possible/JJ exception/NN of/IN the/DT Fed/NP ,/, the/DT dollar/NN sales/NNS were/VBD relatively/RB modest/JJ ./.

During/IN New/NP York/NP activity/NN ,/, bankers/NNS said/VBD the/DT Fed/NP intervened/VBD at/IN the/DT 1.9055-mark/JJ and/CC 142.85-yen/JJ level/NN ,/, spending/NN as/RB much/JJ as/IN $/$ 800/CD million/CD ./. 
The/DT dollar/NN bashing/NN left/VBD currency/NN traders/NNS and/CC analysts/NNS divided/VBN over/IN whether/IN the/DT U.S./NP currency/NN will/MD resume/VB its/PP$ climb/NN toward/IN the/DT critical/JJ 2.00-mark/JJ and/CC 150-yen/JJ levels/NNS ./. 
Some/DT say/VBP it/PP will/MD --/: they/PP argue/VBP that/IN the/DT dollar/NN is/VBZ solidly/RB supported/VBN by/IN the/DT buoyant/JJ American/JJ economy/NN and/CC relatively/RB low/JJ U.S./NP inflation/NN ,/, while/IN U.S./NP inflation-adjusted/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS are/VBP high/JJ compared/VBN with/IN those/DT in/IN Germany/NP and/CC Japan/NP ./.

The/DT U.S./NP currency/NN at/IN one/CD point/NN yesterday/NN traded/VBD as/RB low/JJ as/IN 1.8960/CD marks/NNS and/CC 142.13/CD yen/NNS ./. 
The/DT dollar/NN has/VBZ declined/VBN steadily/RB since/IN Sept./NP 15/CD when/WRB a/DT combination/NN of/IN central-bank/NN intervention/NN and/CC wild/JJ unsubstantiated/JJ rumors/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT shooting/NN of/IN President/NP Bush/NP and/CC the/DT collapse/NN of/IN a/DT major/JJ U.S./NP bank/NN ,/, sent/VBD it/PP tumbling/VBG ./. 
For/IN most/JJS of/IN last/JJ week/NN ,/, the/DT market/NN remained/VBD nervous/JJ while/IN it/PP awaited/VBD the/DT results/NNS of/IN this/DT weekend/NN 's/POS G-7/NN meeting/NN ./.

U.S./NP Treasury/NP efforts/NNS to/TO get/VB the/DT Fed/NP to/TO help/VB bring/VB down/IN the/DT dollar/NN by/IN lowering/VBG interest/NN rates/NNS clearly/RB have/VBP n't/RB born/VBN fruit/NN ./.

``/`` The/DT verbal/JJ intervention/NN and/CC actual/JJ intervention/NN G-7/NN is/VBZ taking/VBG to/TO push/VB the/DT dollar/NN lower/RB is/VBZ working/VBG so/RB far/RB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Mr./NP Prielipp/NP of/IN DG/NP Bank/NP ./.

Outcome/NN :/: The/DT oil/NN producer/NN receives/VBZ $/$ 18/CD a/DT barrel/NN regardless/RB of/IN how/WRB low/JJ prices/NNS might/MD drop/VB ,/, because/IN the/DT bank/NN makes/VBZ up/RP the/DT difference/NN ./.

''/'' Mr./NP Hatch/NP employs/VBZ three/CD part-time/JJ helpers/NNS to/TO open/VB ,/, measure/VB ,/, count/VB and/CC code/VB each/DT piece/NN ./. 
When/WRB these/DT tasks/NNS are/VBP done/VBN ,/, he/PP reads/VBZ it/PP all/DT himself/PP ./.

That/DT 's/VBZ why/WRB mailings/NNS that/WDT look/VBP like/IN checks/NNS or/CC telegrams/VBZ ,/, or/CC that/WDT incorporate/JJ tabs/NNS to/TO pull/VB or/CC cards/NNS to/TO tear/VB apart/RB ,/, are/VBP so/RB successful/JJ ./.

That/DT line/NN ,/, the/DT only/JJ difference/NN between/IN the/DT new/JJ mailing/NN and/CC earlier/JJR ones/NNS ,/, increased/VBD response/NN by/IN 15/CD %/NN ./.

Mr./NP Hatch/NP ,/, who/WP created/VBD direct-mail/JJ offerings/NNS in/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN jobs/NNS and/CC still/RB does/VBZ free-lance/JJ work/NN ,/, devised/VBD a/DT package/NN for/IN the/DT mutual-fund/NN giant/NN Fidelity/NP Investments/NP that/WDT hit/VBD mailboxes/NNS on/IN Oct./NP 19/CD ,/, 1987/CD ./. 
``/`` The/DT mailing/NN got/VBD one/CD letter/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PP says/VBZ ./.

Unificationists/NNS such/JJ as/IN former/JJ Prime/NP Minister/NP Edward/NP Heath/NP and/CC European/NP Commission/NP President/NP Jacques/NP Delors/NP have/VBP so/RB far/RB convinced/VBN the/DT British/JJ public/NN that/IN it/PP ca/MD n't/RB trade/VB more/RBR openly/RB with/IN Europe/NP without/IN also/RB accepting/VBG the/DT dictation/NN of/IN internal/JJ British/JJ policy/NN from/IN the/DT European/JJ bureaucracy/NN ,/, Parliament/NP and/CC courts/NNS ./. 
Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP 's/POS political/JJ future/NN and/CC the/DT future/NN of/IN an/DT independent/JJ Britain/NP may/MD depend/VB on/IN her/PP$ ability/NN to/TO divorce/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN free/JJ trade/NN ,/, which/WDT she/PP favors/VBZ ,/, from/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN diminished/JJ sovereignty/NN ,/, which/WDT she/PP does/VBZ not/RB ./.

The/DT advantages/NNS of/IN free/JJ trade/NN that/WDT have/VBP made/VBN the/DT SEM/NP so/RB attractive/JJ to/TO Europeans/NPS --/: access/NN to/TO new/JJ products/NNS ,/, markets/NNS and/CC raw/JJ materials/NNS ,/, enhanced/JJ competitiveness/NN and/CC lower/JJR consumer/NN prices/NNS --/: also/RB would/MD commend/VB the/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT North/NP Atlantic/NP Free/NP Trade/NP Area/NP (/( NAFTA/NP )/) ./.

With/IN North/JJ American/JJ industries/NNS increasingly/RB worried/JJ about/IN being/VBG locked/VBN out/IN of/IN a/DT ``/`` Fortress/NP Europe/NP ''/'' after/IN 1992/CD ,/, a/DT formal/JJ U.S.-Canada/NP trade/NN agreement/NN with/IN Britain/NP would/MD ensure/VB that/IN North/JJ American/JJ companies/NNS would/MD maintain/VB a/DT vital/JJ link/NN not/RB only/RB with/IN Britain/NP but/CC also/RB --/: via/IN Britain/NP --/: with/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN Europe/NP ./.

Recent/JJ EC/NP attempts/NNS to/TO extend/VB its/PP$ authority/NN over/IN everything/NN from/IN cigarette/NN labels/NNS and/CC management/NN practices/NNS to/TO minimum-wage/NN laws/NNS and/CC tax/NN rates/NNS compare/VBP unfavorably/RB with/IN the/DT less/RBR heavy-handed/JJ North/JJ American/JJ agreement/NN --/: the/DT administration/NN of/IN which/WDT requires/VBZ no/DT separate/JJ parliament/NN or/CC judiciary/NN and/CC no/DT pan-national/JJ bureaucracy/NN ./. 
In/IN short/JJ ,/, it/PP implies/VBZ no/DT renunciation/NN of/IN sovereignty/NN ./. 
An/DT invitation/NN to/TO join/VB in/IN a/DT NAFTA/NP would/MD enable/VB Mrs./NP Thatcher/NP to/TO test/VB European/JJ intentions/NNS prior/RB to/TO 1992/CD ./. 
In/IN the/DT worst/JJS case/NN ,/, if/IN Britain/NP entered/VBD into/IN a/DT separate/JJ agreement/NN with/IN the/DT U.S./NP and/CC Canada/NP ,/, moves/NNS might/MD be/VB made/VBN within/IN the/DT EC/NP to/TO deny/VB Britain/NP membership/NN in/IN the/DT SEM/NP ./.

A/DT byproduct/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ that/IN Digital/NP employs/VBZ large/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN less/RBR than/IN essential/JJ people/NNS ./. 
The/DT personnel/NNS costs/NNS are/VBP considerable/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT returns/NNS no/RB longer/RBR justify/VBP them/PP ./.

The/DT current/JJ challenge/NN is/VBZ what/WP to/TO do/VB now/RB that/IN Digital/NP 's/POS spectacular/JJ growth/NN curve/NN is/VBZ leveling/VBG off/RP ./.

The/DT danger/NN of/IN this/DT strategy/NN is/VBZ that/IN top-notch/JJ workers/NNS ,/, unwilling/JJ to/TO forgo/VB promotions/NNS into/IN administration/NN ,/, will/MD quit/VB ./. 
All/DT salaries/NNS have/VBP been/VBN capped/VBN ,/, and/CC there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT hold/NN on/IN upper-level/JJ stock/NN options/NNS as/RB well/RB ./. 
Early-retirement/NN packages/NNS have/VBP not/RB yet/RB been/VBN offered/VBN ,/, but/CC that/DT strategy/NN often/RB weakens/VBZ an/DT organization/NN considerably/RB ,/, since/IN management/NN ca/MD n't/RB make/VB the/DT offer/NN only/RB to/TO those/DT it/PP wants/VBZ to/TO leave/VB ./. 
Finally/RB ,/, thousands/NNS of/IN manufacturing/VBG people/NNS have/VBP been/VBN sent/VBN to/TO sales/NNS ./. 
This/DT tactic/NN is/VBZ seldom/RB effective/JJ ;/: industrial/JJ musical/JJ chairs/NNS does/VBZ not/RB cut/VBN costs/NNS ,/, nor/CC does/VBZ it/PP produce/VB new/JJ business/NN ./. 
Furthermore/RB ,/, this/DT move/NN emphasizes/VBZ another/DT weak/JJ link/NN in/IN Digital/NP 's/POS management/NN philosophy/NN :/: allowing/VBG the/DT hands-off/JJ management/NN system/NN to/TO work/VB its/PP$ way/NN into/IN the/DT sales/NNS organization/NN ./. 
What/WP was/VBD right/JJ for/IN managing/VBG creative/JJ growth/NN turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB very/RB wrong/JJ for/IN sales/JJ management/NN ,/, where/WRB no/DT innovative/JJ approach/NN was/VBD needed/VBN ./.

While/IN Digital/NP 's/POS products/NNS have/VBP been/VBN outstanding/JJ ,/, they/PP have/VBP not/RB been/VBN matched/VBN with/IN a/DT sales/NNS team/NN of/IN equal/JJ quality/NN ./. 
So/RB long/RB as/IN the/DT products/NNS stood/VBD out/RP so/RB much/RB that/IN they/PP practically/RB sold/VBD themselves/PP ,/, this/DT was/VBD n't/RB much/JJ of/IN a/DT problem/NN ./.

And/CC that/DT can/MD not/RB be/VB remedied/VBN overnight/RB ./. 
The/DT prescription/NN is/VBZ maddeningly/RB simple/JJ ./. 
The/DT late/JJ chairman/NN of/IN Parade/NP Magazine/NP ,/, Arthur/NP ``/`` Red/NP ''/'' Motley/NP --/: who/WP coined/VBD the/DT phrase/NN ``/`` Nothing/NN Happens/VBZ Till/IN Somebody/NN Sells/VBZ Something/NN ''/'' --/: set/VBD forth/RB the/DT formula/NN for/IN success/NN in/IN sales/NNS in/IN just/RB 15/CD words/NNS :/: ``/`` Know/VB your/PP$ customer/NN ./.

Ask/VB all/DT to/TO buy/VB ./. 
''/'' Meeting/VBG this/DT challenge/NN is/VBZ well/RB beyond/IN Digital/NP 's/POS current/JJ sales/NNS management/NN group/NN ./. 
Under/IN ideal/JJ conditions/NNS ,/, it/PP would/MD take/VB a/DT minimum/NN of/IN 18/CD months/NNS and/CC more/RBR like/IN 36/CD months/NNS to/TO produce/VB an/DT effective/JJ selling/NN team/NN ./. 
At/IN some/DT point/NN ,/, something/NN must/MD give/VB ./. 
The/DT deficiency/NN in/IN sales/NNS management/NN is/VBZ just/RB about/RB an/DT insurmountable/JJ obstacle/NN ./. 
But/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT greater/JJR lesson/NN from/IN Digital/NP 's/POS recent/JJ travails/NNS :/: Despite/IN the/DT success/NN of/IN a/DT particular/JJ management/NN technique/NN ,/, a/DT company/NN must/MD always/RB have/VB the/DT flexibility/NN to/TO alter/VB that/DT technique/NN as/IN conditions/NNS change/VBP ./.

The/DT ``/`` bubble/NN ''/'' of/IN course/NN refers/VBZ to/TO the/DT anomaly/NN that/IN some/DT upper-middle-income/JJ taxpayers/NNS pay/VBP a/DT marginal/JJ tax/NN rate/NN of/IN 33/CD %/NN ,/, while/IN higher-income/JJ people/NNS pay/VBP a/DT marginal/JJ rate/NN of/IN 28/CD %/NN ./. 
Richard/NP Gephardt/NP and/CC the/DT Democratic/JJ leadership/NN in/IN Congress/NP somehow/RB think/VBP this/DT anomaly/NN offers/VBZ a/DT populist/JJ and/CC tax-revenue/NN bonanza/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB are/VBP proposing/VBG that/IN the/DT 33/CD %/NN rate/NN apply/VB to/TO all/DT levels/NNS of/IN income/NN ./.

We/PP suppose/VBP we/PP should/MD be/VB gratified/JJ that/IN the/DT Gephardt/NP Democrats/NPS now/RB think/VBP the/DT marginal/JJ rate/NN is/VBZ the/DT rate/NN ./. 
Except/IN that/DT in/IN terms/NNS of/IN who/WP pays/VBZ more/JJR tax/NN ,/, what/WP matters/VBZ is/VBZ average/JJ rates/NNS ./. 
In/IN this/DT sense/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT bubble/NN ./. 
The/DT bubble/NN anomaly/NN results/VBZ because/IN the/DT 1986/CD tax/NN bill/NN established/VBD two/CD basic/JJ rates/NNS ,/, 15/CD %/NN and/CC 28/CD %/NN ./. 
Normally/RB everyone/NN would/MD get/VB the/DT lower/JJR rate/NN on/IN the/DT first/JJ bracket/NN of/IN income/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT tax/NN writers/NNS decided/VBD to/TO phase/VB out/RP this/DT benefit/NN as/IN incomes/NNS increased/VBD ./.

However/RB ,/, some/DT part/NN of/IN such/JJ income/NN is/VBZ taxed/VBN at/IN only/RB 15/CD %/NN ,/, so/IN the/DT average/JJ rate/NN remains/VBZ below/IN 28/CD %/NN ./.

Despite/IN the/DT marginal-rate/NN bubble/NN ,/, in/IN short/JJ ,/, no/DT taxpayer/NN pays/VBZ an/DT average/JJ rate/NN more/JJR than/IN 28/CD %/NN ./. 
Or/CC to/TO put/VB it/PP in/IN Gephardtian/JJ class-warfare/NN terms/NNS ,/, the/DT rich/JJ still/RB pay/VBP more/JJR taxes/NNS than/IN the/DT middle/JJ class/NN ./. 
We/PP are/VBP not/RB suggesting/VBG that/IN the/DT 33/CD %/NN rate/NN is/VBZ n't/RB an/DT extra/JJ burden/NN on/IN many/JJ taxpayers/NNS ./. 
Marginal/JJ rates/NNS ,/, not/RB average/JJ rates/NNS ,/, are/VBP what/WP determine/VBP incentive/NN effects/NNS and/CC economic/JJ production/NN ./. 
We/PP certainly/RB would/MD support/VB closing/VBG the/DT bubble/NN with/IN a/DT 28/CD %/NN rate/NN with/IN no/DT phase-out/NN of/IN lower/JJR brackets/NNS ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN a/DT 28/CD %/NN top/JJ marginal/JJ rate/NN and/CC lower/JJR taxes/NNS for/IN the/DT middle/JJ class/NN in/IN general/JJ and/CC two-income/JJ families/NNS in/IN particular/JJ ./. 
This/DT did/VBD not/RB happen/VB in/IN 1986/CD because/IN of/IN feared/JJ revenue/NN losses/NNS based/VBN on/IN static/JJ revenue/NN estimates/NNS ,/, though/IN we/PP doubt/VBP that/IN losses/NNS would/MD be/VB severe/JJ in/IN a/DT real/JJ ,/, dynamic/JJ world/NN ./. 
The/DT point/NN to/TO keep/VB in/IN mind/NN now/RB is/VBZ that/IN the/DT Gephardt/NP proposal/NN ,/, closing/VBG the/DT bubble/NN with/IN a/DT new/JJ 33/CD %/NN top/JJ rate/NN ,/, does/VBZ nothing/NN whatever/RB for/IN these/DT taxpayers/NNS ./.

Recent/JJ research/NN on/IN the/DT subject/NN suggests/VBZ that/IN American/JJ productivity/NN is/VBZ simply/RB not/RB in/IN a/DT period/NN of/IN long-term/JJ decline/NN ./. 
Earlier/RB this/DT month/NN ,/, the/DT Bureau/NP of/IN Labor/NP Statistics/NPS revised/VBD the/DT GNP/NP numbers/NNS for/IN 1986/CD ,/, 1987/CD and/CC 1988/CD sharply/RB upward/JJ ./.

If/IN the/DT only/JJ people/NNS in/IN the/DT labor/NN force/NN were/VBD 10/CD experienced/VBN ,/, highly/RB trained/VBN and/CC highly/RB motivated/VBN individuals/NNS ,/, then/RB productivity/NN rates/NNS would/MD be/VB awesome/JJ ./.

During/IN this/DT recovery/NN ,/, the/DT labor/NN force/NN has/VBZ grown/VBN at/IN 2.5/CD %/NN a/DT year/NN ./. 
As/IN less/RBR experienced/JJ and/CC less/RBR highly/RB trained/VBN people/NNS are/VBP brought/VBN into/IN the/DT work/NN force/NN ,/, the/DT productivity/NN figures/NNS should/MD suffer/VB ./.

Last/JJ year/NN ,/, Martin/NP Neil/NP Baily/NP of/IN the/DT Brookings/NP Institution/NP and/CC Robert/NP J./NP Gordon/NP of/IN Northwestern/NP reported/VBD that/IN due/JJ to/TO mismeasurement/NN ,/, productivity/NN figures/NNS since/IN 1973/CD underestimated/VBD true/JJ productivity/NN by/IN as/RB much/JJ as/IN a/DT third/JJ ./.

At/IN a/DT breakfast/NN meeting/NN Friday/NP ,/, Mr./NP Skinner/NP asked/VBD Northwest/NP owner/NN Alfred/NP Checchi/NP to/TO reduce/VB the/DT dollar/NN amount/NN of/IN KLM/NP 's/POS $/$ 400/CD million/CD investment/NN in/IN NWA/NP ,/, the/DT same/JJ people/NNS said/VBD ./. 
KLM/NP made/VBD the/DT investment/NN to/TO help/VB Mr./NP Checchi/NP ,/, a/DT Los/NP Angeles/NP investor/NN ,/, finance/VB a/DT $/$ 3.65/CD billion/CD leveraged/JJ buy-out/NN of/IN Northwest/NP parent/NN NWA/NP Inc./NP that/WDT closed/VBD in/IN July/NP ./. 
Mr./NP Skinner/NP and/CC other/JJ Transportation/NP officials/NNS have/VBP voiced/VBN concerns/NNS about/IN both/DT the/DT level/NN of/IN indebtedness/NN and/CC degree/NN of/IN foreign/JJ influence/NN in/IN recent/JJ airline/NN takeovers/NNS ./. 
Although/IN foreign/JJ companies/NNS are/VBP limited/VBN to/TO 25/CD %/NN ownership/NN of/IN U.S./NP airlines/NNS ,/, KLM/NP accounted/VBD for/IN 57/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT $/$ 700/CD million/CD in/IN equity/NN raised/VBN by/IN Mr./NP Checchi/NP for/IN his/PP$ purchase/NN ./. 
Officially/NP ,/, KLM/NP owns/VBZ only/RB 5/CD %/NN of/IN Northwest/NP because/IN its/PP$ investment/NN is/VBZ mostly/RB in/IN nonvoting/JJ preferred/JJ stock/NN ./. 
However/RB ,/, some/DT outsiders/NNS have/VBP speculated/VBN that/IN the/DT dollar/NN amount/NN of/IN KLM/NP 's/POS investment/NN might/MD enable/VB it/PP to/TO wield/VB substantial/JJ influence/NN over/IN the/DT airline/NN ./. 
Rumors/NNS about/IN possible/JJ changes/NNS in/IN KLM/NP 's/POS role/NN in/IN Northwest/NP sparked/VBD a/DT sell-off/NN in/IN UAL/NP shares/NNS Friday/NP ./. 
Their/PP$ price/NN tumbled/VBD $/$ 5.125/CD to/TO $/$ 281.125/CD in/IN composite/JJ trading/NN on/IN the/DT New/NP York/NP Stock/NP Exchange/NP ,/, on/IN fears/NNS that/IN British/NP Air/NP 's/POS $/$ 750/CD million/CD UAL/NP investment/NN might/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB restructured/VBN along/IN the/DT same/JJ lines/NNS as/IN KLM/NP 's/POS ./. 
Mr./NP Checchi/NP declined/VBD to/TO comment/VB ./. 
A/DT spokesman/NN for/IN the/DT Transportation/NP Department/NP confirmed/VBD that/IN Mr./NP Skinner/NP reviewed/VBD the/DT findings/NNS of/IN his/PP$ agency/NN 's/POS study/NN of/IN the/DT NWA/NP takeover/NN with/IN Mr./NP Checchi/NP on/IN Friday/NP ./. 
An/DT announcement/NN of/IN those/DT findings/NNS is/VBZ expected/VBN sometime/RB later/RB this/DT week/NN ./. 
One/CD person/NN familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT situation/NN said/VBD Mr./NP Skinner/NP is/VBZ seeking/VBG a/DT reduction/NN in/IN KLM/NP 's/POS Northwest/NP investment/NN from/IN $/$ 400/CD million/CD to/TO $/$ 175/CD million/CD ,/, an/DT amount/NN that/WDT would/MD equal/VB 25/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT $/$ 700/CD million/CD in/IN equity/NN raised/VBN by/IN Mr./NP Checchi/NP ./. 
Some/DT news/NN reports/NNS said/VBD Mr./NP Skinner/NP might/MD also/RB ask/VB Mr./NP Checchi/NP to/TO drop/VB KLM/NP from/IN the/DT new/JJ Northwest/NP board/NN ,/, submit/VB financial/JJ reports/NNS monthly/RB ,/, instead/RB of/IN quarterly/RB ,/, and/CC give/VB the/DT Transportation/NP Department/NP veto/NN power/NN over/IN any/DT refinancing/NN of/IN Northwest/NP 's/POS $/$ 3.35/CD billion/CD in/IN bank/NN debt/NN ./. 
It/PP did/VBD n't/RB seem/VB likely/JJ that/IN any/DT of/IN Mr./NP Skinner/NP 's/POS demands/NNS will/MD pose/VB any/DT grave/JJ threat/NN to/TO Northwest/NP or/CC its/PP$ financial/JJ health/NN ./. 
But/CC they/PP have/VBP serious/JJ implications/NNS for/IN the/DT UAL/NP takeover/NN because/IN its/PP$ structure/NN mirrors/VBZ that/DT of/IN KLM-Northwest/NP ./. 
While/IN British/NP Air/NP will/MD officially/RB have/VB only/RB a/DT 15/CD %/NN voting/JJ interest/NN in/IN United/NP ,/, its/PP$ equity/NN contribution/NN accounts/VBZ for/IN 78/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT total/JJ equity/NN of/IN $/$ 965/CD million/CD ./. 
According/VBG to/TO the/DT formal/JJ tender/NN offer/NN for/IN UAL/NP released/VBN Friday/NP ,/, the/DT British/NP Air/NP investment/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB in/IN three/CD different/JJ securities/NNS ./. 
In/IN theory/NN at/IN least/JJS ,/, two/CD of/IN them/PP could/MD be/VB reassigned/VBN to/TO other/JJ investors/NNS to/TO meet/VB possible/JJ Transportation/NP Department/NP concerns/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT British/NP Air/NP investment/NN had/VBD to/TO be/VB reduced/VBN to/TO 25/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT equity/NN cash/NN in/IN the/DT UAL/NP buy-out/NN ,/, the/DT first/JJ two/CD preferred/JJ issues/NNS ,/, which/WDT total/VBP $/$ 500/CD million/CD with/IN a/DT combined/JJ dividend/NN rate/NN of/IN 16/CD %/NN ,/, could/MD be/VB attractive/JJ to/TO other/JJ investors/NNS ./. 
However/RB ,/, those/DT outside/JJ investors/NNS might/MD seek/VB a/DT voting/JJ equity/NN stake/NN as/IN well/RB ,/, forcing/VBG changes/NNS on/IN a/DT fragile/JJ coalition/NN of/IN UAL/NP management/NN ,/, the/DT airline/NN 's/POS pilot/NN union/NN ,/, and/CC British/NP Air/NP ./. 
During/IN the/DT takeover/NN battles/NNS for/IN both/DT NWA/NP and/CC UAL/NP ,/, Mr./NP Skinner/NP and/CC other/JJ Transportation/NP Department/NP officials/NNS have/VBP repeatedly/RB expressed/VBN concern/NN about/IN the/DT questions/NNS of/IN leverage/NN and/CC foreign-airline/NN influence/NN ./. 
But/CC many/JJ takeover/NN stock/NN traders/NNS paid/VBD little/JJ heed/NN because/IN ,/, until/IN now/RB ,/, the/DT officials/NNS '/POS actions/NNS have/VBP n't/RB matched/VBN their/PP$ rhetoric/NN ./. 
The/DT stock/NN traders/NNS have/VBP been/VBN inclined/VBN to/TO believe/VB Mr./NP Skinner/NP was/VBD merely/RB trying/VBG to/TO put/VB on/RP a/DT show/NN of/IN investigating/VBG the/DT issues/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO pre-empt/JJ criticism/NN by/IN congressional/JJ Democrats/NPS that/IN the/DT Bush/NP administration/NN was/VBD being/VBG too/RB lenient/JJ in/IN allowing/VBG the/DT takeovers/NNS ./. 
If/IN Mr./NP Skinner/NP forces/NNS changes/NNS that/WDT cut/VBP the/DT price/NN of/IN the/DT UAL/NP takeover/NN or/CC cause/VB it/PP to/TO unravel/VB ,/, their/PP$ misjudgment/NN could/MD cost/VB them/PP dearly/RB ./.

''/'' While/IN this/DT was/VBD an/DT overstatement/NN ,/, GATT/NP 's/POS hold/NN on/IN life/NN has/VBZ become/VBN shaky/JJ ./. 
The/DT General/NP Agreement/NP ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, is/VBZ a/DT voluntary/JJ association/NN of/IN nations/NNS ./. 
It/PP thrived/VBD in/IN the/DT 1950s/CD and/CC 1960s/CD ,/, because/IN all/DT of/IN the/DT nations/NNS were/VBD headed/VBN in/IN one/CD direction/NN ./. 
GATT/NP was/VBD part/NN of/IN the/DT post-World/NP War/NP II/NP plan/NN to/TO promote/VB a/DT more/RBR peaceful/JJ and/CC prosperous/JJ world/NN ./.

Free-trade/JJ sentiment/NN had/VBD been/VBN growing/VBG in/IN the/DT U.S./NP through/IN the/DT 1930s/CD ,/, a/DT trend/NN exemplified/VBN by/IN Secretary/NP of/IN State/NP Cordell/NP Hull/NP 's/POS reciprocal/JJ trade/NN agreements/NNS ./. 
In/IN 1945/CD and/CC 1946/CD the/DT U.S./NP officially/RB proposed/VBD a/DT permanent/JJ International/NP Trade/NP Organization/NP ,/, attached/VBN to/TO the/DT United/NP Nations/NPS ,/, so/IN that/IN continuing/VBG attention/NN could/MD be/VB given/VBN to/TO reducing/VBG trade/NN barriers/NNS among/IN nations/NNS ./.

Some/DT scholars/NNS did/VBD object/NN to/TO the/DT idea/NN that/IN tariff/NN reductions/NNS should/MD be/VB made/VBN on/IN a/DT multilateral/JJ basis/NN ,/, but/CC only/RB because/IN they/PP thought/VBD the/DT U.S./NP should/MD retain/VB the/DT right/NN to/TO cut/VB --/: that/DT 's/VBZ right/JJ ,/, cut/VB --/: tariffs/NPS unilaterally/RB ./. 
Everything/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB working/VBG out/IN well/RB ./.

So/IN GATT/NP was/VBD born/VBN ,/, a/DT body/NN without/IN a/DT head/NN ./. 
But/CC what/WP did/VBD it/PP matter/NN ?/. 
If/IN everyone/NN was/VBD for/IN free/JJ trade/NN ,/, life/NN would/MD be/VB easy/JJ ./. 
The/DT U.S./NP commitment/NN to/TO free/JJ trade/NN was/VBD in/IN part/NN philanthropic/JJ ./. 
Foreign/JJ trade/NN played/VBD a/DT very/RB small/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT U.S./NP economy/NN ./.

It/PP was/VBD not/RB ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, that/DT way/NN elsewhere/RB ./. 
Other/JJ countries/NNS had/VBD seen/VBN their/PP$ industrial/JJ plants/NNS devastated/VBN by/IN the/DT war/NN ,/, and/CC they/PP were/VBD slowly/RB trying/VBG to/TO work/VB their/PP$ way/NN back/RB into/IN world/NN markets/NNS ./. 
The/DT U.S./NP was/VBD more/JJR than/IN willing/JJ to/TO help/VB ./. 
Up/IN to/TO a/DT point/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ./. 
As/IN Harvard/NP economist/NN John/NP Kenneth/NP Galbraith/NP once/RB wrote/VBD ,/, ``/`` It/PP has/VBZ been/VBN sufficiently/RB established/VBN that/IN nothing/NN in/IN economics/NNS is/VBZ forever/RB ./. 
''/'' In/IN the/DT 1970s/CD and/CC 1980s/CD ,/, increasing/VBG competition/NN from/IN Japan/NP ,/, Taiwan/NP ,/, South/NP Korea/NP and/CC even/RB from/IN Europe/NP substantially/RB weakened/VBD the/DT U.S./NP commitment/NN to/TO free/JJ trade/NN ./. 
Once/RB again/RB American/JJ businessmen/NNS and/CC farmers/NNS were/VBD calling/VBG for/IN increased/VBN protection/NN ./. 
There/EX has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN some/DT reason/NN to/TO suspect/VB that/IN some/DT economists/NNS follow/VBP the/DT crowd/NN ./. 
Only/RB a/DT few/JJ years/NNS before/IN ,/, the/DT economic/JJ fraternity/NN had/VBD been/VBN almost/RB unanimous/JJ in/IN its/PP$ support/NN for/IN unfettered/JJ trade/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT 1970s/CD and/CC 1980s/CD ,/, however/RB ,/, it/PP has/VBZ become/VBN respectable/JJ to/TO talk/VB of/IN ``/`` industrial/JJ policy/NN ''/'' and/CC even/RB of/IN ``/`` managed/VBN trade/NN ./. 
''/'' That/DT 's/VBZ why/WRB it/PP was/VBD so/RB brave/JJ to/TO launch/VB the/DT Uruguay/NP Round/NP in/IN 1986/CD ,/, more/JJR or/CC less/RBR throwing/VBG it/PP into/IN the/DT teeth/NNS of/IN the/DT protectionist/JJ storm/NN ./. 
It/PP was/VBD indeed/RB vital/JJ to/TO try/VB to/TO recover/VB some/DT GATT/NP momentum/NN ./. 
But/CC the/DT chances/NNS of/IN doing/VBG so/RB were/VBD reduced/VBN by/IN pushing/VBG the/DT nations/NNS into/IN areas/NNS previously/RB left/VBN carefully/RB untouched/JJ :/: services/NNS and/CC agriculture/NN ./. 
If/IN the/DT negotiations/NNS had/VBD sought/VBN merely/RB another/DT round/NN of/IN modest/JJ tariff-cutting/NN ,/, the/DT likelihood/NN of/IN ultimate/JJ success/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN quite/RB a/DT bit/NN greater/JJR ./. 
The/DT key/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN member/NN nations/NNS ,/, particularly/RB the/DT U.S./NP ,/, do/VBP n't/RB trust/VB GATT/NP 's/POS administrative/JJ machinery/NN ./. 
When/WRB the/DT ITO/NP died/VBD aborning/RB ,/, a/DT machinery/NN was/VBD gradually/RB built/VBN for/IN GATT/NP ./. 
There/EX was/VBD no/DT great/JJ urgency/NN about/IN this/DT construction/NN project/NN ,/, since/IN there/EX was/VBD relatively/RB little/JJ controversy/NN ./. 
Even/RB the/DT European/NP Community/NP ,/, which/WDT some/DT had/VBD feared/VBN would/MD be/VB protectionist/JJ ,/, turned/VBD out/IN to/TO be/VB fairly/RB friendly/JJ ./. 
In/IN the/DT 1970s/CD and/CC 1980s/CD ,/, however/RB ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN disputes/NNS ,/, not/RB all/DT begun/VBN by/IN the/DT U.S/NP ./. 
Under/IN GATT/NP procedures/VBZ the/DT controversies/NNS drag/VBP on/IN and/CC on/IN ./. 
When/WRB there/EX are/VBP solutions/NNS ,/, some/DT participants/NNS do/VBP n't/RB recognize/VB them/PP as/RB such/JJ ./. 
GATT/NP rules/NNS are/VBP n't/RB always/RB clear/JJ --/: in/IN part/NN because/IN ,/, before/IN the/DT 1970s/CD ,/, they/PP had/VBD n't/RB really/RB been/VBN tested/VBN ./. 
Now/RB a/DT number/NN of/IN nations/NNS ,/, especially/RB the/DT U.S./NP ,/, do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO trust/VB the/DT rules/NNS ./. 
Instead/RB ,/, there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT growing/VBG inclination/NN for/IN a/DT do-it-yourself/JJ policy/NN ,/, a/DT revival/NN of/IN unilateralism/NN ./. 
Of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT current/JJ idea/NN stands/VBZ the/DT unilateralism/NN some/DT economists/NNS favored/VBD four/CD decades/NNS ago/IN on/IN its/PP$ head/NN --/: increasing/VBG trade/NN restrictions/NNS ,/, not/RB reducing/VBG them/PP ./. 
The/DT Reagan/NP administration/NN came/VBD into/IN office/NN in/IN 1981/CD with/IN a/DT firm/JJ commitment/NN to/TO free/JJ trade/NN ,/, but/CC Ronald/NP Reagan/NP ,/, pushed/VBN by/IN Congress/NP and/CC businessmen/NNS ,/, soon/RB became/VBD the/DT most/RBS protectionist/JJ president/NN in/IN the/DT past/JJ half/NN century/NN ./. 
Hardly/RB anyone/NN even/RB thought/VBD of/IN submitting/VBG trade/NN disputes/NNS to/TO GATT/NP ;/: businessmen/NNS obviously/RB figured/VBD they/PP could/MD do/VB better/RB by/IN going/VBG to/TO Washington/NP ./. 
The/DT approach/NN was/VBD so/RB crass/JJ that/IN some/DT unilateralists/NNS have/VBP sought/VBN to/TO justify/VB it/PP ./. 
A/DT prime/JJ argument/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT U.S./NP is/VBZ more/RBR open/JJ to/TO trade/VB than/IN many/JJ of/IN its/PP$ partners/NNS ,/, so/IN it/PP 's/VBZ OK/JJ to/TO push/VB the/DT partners/NNS to/TO make/VB unilateral/JJ concessions/NNS ./. 
The/DT chief/NN objection/NN to/TO the/DT better-than-thou/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PP is/VBZ n't/RB true/JJ ./. 
A/DT high/JJ U.S./NP trade/NN official/NN ,/, once/RB asked/VBD how/WRB the/DT U.S./NP compared/VBN with/IN its/PP$ trading/VBG partners/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN restraints/NNS ,/, replied/VBD ,/, in/IN strictest/JJS confidence/NN ,/, ``/`` It/PP 's/VBZ about/IN 50-50/CD ./. 
''/'' The/DT GATT/NP machinery/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB improved/VBN or/CC replaced/VBN with/IN something/NN like/IN the/DT proposed/VBN International/NP Trade/NP Organization/NP ./.

Secretary/NP of/IN Transportation/NP Samuel/NP Skinner/NP is/VBZ planning/VBG to/TO issue/VB a/DT national/JJ transportation/NN policy/NN next/IN spring/NN ./. 
No/DT one/NN knows/VBZ what/WP the/DT secretary/NN intends/VBZ to/TO propose/VB ,/, but/CC the/DT signs/NNS are/VBP ominous/JJ ./. 
The/DT last/JJ time/NN the/DT government/NN came/VBD up/IN with/IN a/DT plan/NN for/IN a/DT major/JJ industry/NN ,/, the/DT country/NN got/VBD an/DT industrial/JJ policy/NN for/IN energy/NN that/WDT resulted/VBD in/IN fraud/NN ,/, foul-ups/NNS ,/, and/CC fuel/NN lines/NNS ./. 
If/IN a/DT transportation/NN plan/NN focused/VBD on/IN those/DT decisions/NNS by/IN government/NN that/WDT could/MD produce/VB a/DT more/RBR flexible/JJ and/CC cheaper/JJR transportation/NN system/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN deregulation/NN of/IN surface/NN freight/NN transportation/NN ,/, it/PP could/MD be/VB useful/JJ ./. 
Unfortunately/RB ,/, given/VBN the/DT tenor/NN of/IN the/DT preliminary/JJ material/NN on/IN the/DT plan/NN issued/VBN by/IN the/DT Department/NP of/IN Transportation/NP ,/, the/DT federal/JJ government/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO become/VB more/RBR heavily/RB involved/VBN in/IN transportation/NN issues/NNS ,/, perhaps/RB usurping/VBG some/DT of/IN the/DT authority/NN and/CC activities/NNS of/IN local/JJ officials/NNS ./. 
Even/RB more/RBR disturbing/JJ was/VBD Tuesday/NP 's/POS speech/NN by/IN Secretary/NP Skinner/NP to/TO the/DT International/NP Aviation/NP Club/NP ./. 
In/IN this/DT talk/NN ,/, he/PP expressed/VBD his/PP$ intention/NN of/IN restraining/VBG foreign/JJ investment/NN in/IN U.S./NP airlines/NNS and/CC ensuring/VBG that/IN any/DT acquisitions/NNS of/IN U.S./NP airlines/NNS not/RB lead/VB to/TO ``/`` excessive/JJ debt/NN ''/'' that/WDT might/MD jeopardize/VB passenger/NN safety/NN ./. 
Mr./NP Skinner/NP 's/POS concern/NN with/IN foreign/JJ ownership/NN ,/, already/RB restricted/VBN by/IN law/NN to/TO 25/CD %/NN of/IN any/DT airline/NN ,/, is/VBZ puzzling/JJ ./. 
If/IN 20/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT stockholders/NNS of/IN an/DT airline/NN reside/VBP in/IN London/NP ,/, England/NP ,/, rather/RB than/IN London/NP ,/, Ohio/NP ,/, Londontowne/NP ,/, Md./NP ,/, or/CC Londonderry/NP ,/, N.H./NP ,/, that/WDT can/MD not/RB make/VB any/DT economic/JJ ,/, national/JJ security/NN or/CC safety/NN difference/NN ./. 
Does/VBZ the/DT secretary/NN believe/VB that/IN foreign/JJ owners/NNS ,/, if/IN they/PP could/MD exercise/VB control/NN ,/, would/MD withdraw/VB service/NN on/IN profitable/JJ routes/NNS ?/. 
Or/CC that/IN domestic/JJ shareholders/NNS would/MD favor/VB operating/VBG an/DT unprofitable/JJ service/NN ?/. 
Perhaps/RB Mr./NP Skinner/NP is/VBZ concerned/VBN that/IN a/DT foreign/JJ airline/NN might/MD use/VB its/PP$ leverage/NN to/TO attract/VB transit/NN passengers/NNS to/TO foreign/JJ destinations/NNS from/IN its/PP$ partially/RB owned/VBN U.S./NP affiliate/NN ./. 
If/IN there/EX were/VBD any/DT harm/NN in/IN this/DT arrangement/NN (/( many/JJ U.S./NP airlines/NNS have/VBP similar/JJ links/NNS to/TO partially/RB or/CC wholly/RB owned/VBN local/JJ carriers/NNS )/) ,/, it/PP would/MD be/VB an/DT antitrust/JJ matter/NN ,/, better/RB left/VBN to/TO the/DT expertise/NN of/IN the/DT Justice/NP Department/NP ./. 
Mr./NP Skinner/NP 's/POS concern/NN about/IN ``/`` excessive/JJ debt/NN ''/'' also/RB seems/VBZ misplaced/VBN ./. 
The/DT Transportation/NP Department/NP 's/POS own/JJ studies/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN that/DT safety/NN and/CC financial/JJ health/NN are/VBP unrelated/JJ ./. 
Does/VBZ the/DT secretary/NN lack/VB confidence/NN in/IN the/DT Federal/NP Aviation/NP Authority/NP 's/POS ability/NN to/TO monitor/VB safety/NN and/CC maintenance/NN ?/. 
Or/CC does/VBZ he/PP disbelieve/VB his/PP$ own/JJ department/NN 's/POS evidence/NN ?/. 
The/DT appropriate/JJ debt\/equity/NN ratio/NN for/IN an/DT airline/NN is/VBZ best/RB left/VBN to/TO the/DT market/NN ./. 
If/IN an/DT air/NN carrier/NN takes/VBZ on/IN excessive/JJ debt/NN ,/, that/DT will/MD be/VB reflected/VBN in/IN the/DT value/NN of/IN its/PP$ stock/NN ./. 
The/DT safety/NN of/IN passengers/NNS ,/, unlike/IN the/DT safety/NN of/IN shareholders/NNS ,/, will/MD remain/VB unaffected/JJ ./. 
Mr./NP Skinner/NP 's/POS speech/NN and/CC the/DT material/NN issued/VBN by/IN the/DT department/NN on/IN the/DT proposed/VBN national/JJ policy/NN imply/VBP that/IN the/DT Transportation/NP Department/NP intends/VBZ to/TO take/VB a/DT more/RBR active/JJ role/NN ./. 
But/CC judging/VBG from/IN the/DT record/NN ,/, whenever/WRB the/DT federal/JJ government/NN becomes/VBZ deeply/RB involved/VBN in/IN transportation/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN by/IN regulating/VBG a/DT mode/NN ,/, or/CC by/IN providing/VBG the/DT infrastructure/NN ,/, the/DT system/NN suffers/VBZ ./. 
One/CD of/IN the/DT major/JJ problems/NNS facing/VBG the/DT transportation/NN sectors/NNS involves/VBZ congestion/NN at/IN busy/JJ airports/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ at/IN least/JJS partly/RB due/JJ to/TO the/DT air/NN traffic/NN control/NN system/NN ./. 
Another/DT impediment/NN to/TO low-cost/JJ transportation/NN is/VBZ the/DT remaining/VBG requirements/NNS for/IN truckers/NNS to/TO file/VB rates/NNS ,/, which/WDT sometimes/RB are/VBP suspended/VBN or/CC denied/VBN ,/, coupled/VBN with/IN the/DT continued/VBN precondition/NN that/IN new/JJ carriers/NNS apply/VBP for/IN and/CC secure/VBP certificates/NNS of/IN public/JJ convenience/NN and/CC necessity/NN before/IN they/PP can/MD operate/VB ./. 
At/IN a/DT minimum/NN this/DT increases/VBZ paperwork/NN ,/, legal/JJ fees/NNS ,/, and/CC costs/NNS ;/: it/PP can/MD also/RB result/VB in/IN higher/JJR tariffs/NNS than/IN carriers/NNS and/CC shippers/NNS want/VBP ./. 
Rail/NN carriers/NNS remain/VBP constrained/VBN in/IN their/PP$ freedom/NN to/TO abandon/VB unprofitable/JJ lines/NNS or/CC to/TO price/VB freely/RB in/IN certain/JJ markets/NNS ./. 
Not/RB only/RB does/VBZ this/DT restrain/VB railroads/NNS in/IN their/PP$ ability/NN to/TO compete/VB but/CC it/PP raises/VBZ their/PP$ costs/NNS ./. 
And/CC when/WRB the/DT federal/JJ government/NN dredges/VBZ harbors/NNS and/CC rivers/NNS ,/, builds/VBZ locks/NNS or/CC constructs/VBZ highways/NNS ,/, it/PP subsidizes/VBZ rail/NN 's/POS competitors/NNS ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ noteworthy/JJ that/IN only/RB incidentally/RB has/VBZ the/DT secretary/NN or/CC the/DT department/NN raised/VBN the/DT issues/NNS of/IN regulation/NN and/CC deregulation/NN ./. 
Unfortunately/RB ,/, federal/JJ regulation/NN can/MD and/CC still/RB does/VBZ in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN surface/NN freight/NN transportation/NN have/VB a/DT major/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT industry/NN and/CC the/DT cost/NN of/IN moving/VBG goods/NNS ./. 
Any/DT federal/JJ policy/NN guidelines/NNS for/IN transportation/NN must/MD consider/VB regulation\/deregulation/NN ./. 
The/DT department/NN 's/POS publications/NNS are/VBP now/RB actually/RB claiming/VBG that/IN rates/NNS and/CC entry/NN conditions/NNS of/IN freight/NN carriers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN deregulated/VBN ,/, when/WRB the/DT truth/NN is/VBZ that/DT regulation/NN has/VBZ been/VBN reduced/VBN but/CC certainly/RB not/RB abandoned/VBN ./. 
And/CC nowhere/RB is/VBZ there/EX any/DT hint/NN that/IN further/JJ deregulation/NN is/VBZ intended/VBN ./. 
Another/DT glaring/JJ omission/NN is/VBZ the/DT absence/NN of/IN any/DT reference/NN to/TO the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT FAA/NP ,/, the/DT possibility/NN of/IN privatization/NN of/IN some/DT aspects/NNS of/IN air/NN traffic/NN control/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT use/NN of/IN landing/NN fees/NNS to/TO reduce/VB congestion/NN ./. 
Studies/NNS have/VBP indicated/VBN that/IN a/DT private/JJ sector/NN air/NN traffic/NN system/NN would/MD be/VB more/RBR flexible/JJ and/CC produce/VB fewer/JJR delays/NNS and/CC reduced/VBN congestion/NN ./. 
And/CC while/IN setting/VBG landing/NN fees/NNS should/MD be/VB the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN the/DT local/JJ airport/NN authority/NN ,/, the/DT department/NN ruled/VBD last/JJ winter/NN that/IN peak/JJ load/NN prices/NNS set/VBN by/IN Boston/NP 's/POS Logan/NP Airport/NP to/TO reduce/VB crowding/VBG in/IN a/DT market-oriented/JJ way/NN were/VBD discriminatory/JJ ./. 
Many/JJ of/IN the/DT topics/NNS that/IN the/DT department/NN intends/VBZ to/TO address/VB with/IN its/PP$ new/JJ national/JJ policy/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN urban/JJ transportation/NN congestion/NN ,/, are/VBP primarily/RB state/NN and/CC local/JJ issues/NNS ./. 
While/IN funding/NN of/IN local/JJ transportation/NN systems/NNS has/VBZ often/RB relied/VBN in/IN part/NN on/IN federal/JJ taxpayers/NNS '/POS dollars/NNS ,/, the/DT planning/NN and/CC actual/JJ development/NN of/IN regional/JJ strategies/NNS traditionally/RB have/VBP been/VBN a/DT local/JJ responsibility/NN ./. 
We/PP are/VBP left/VBN to/TO wonder/VB whether/IN this/DT will/MD continue/VB to/TO be/VB true/JJ ./. 
Do/VBP we/PP need/VB a/DT national/JJ plan/NN ?/. 
The/DT U.S./NP has/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS transportation/NN systems/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN ./. 
The/DT private/JJ sector/NN 's/POS responses/NNS to/TO shippers/NNS and/CC travelers/NNS have/VBP created/VBN an/DT incredibly/RB efficient/JJ and/CC low/JJ cost/NN network/NN ./. 
There/EX are/VBP bottlenecks/NNS and/CC inefficiencies/NNS but/CC these/DT result/VBP typically/RB from/IN inadequate/JJ governmentally/RB provided/VBN infrastructure/NN or/CC from/IN the/DT remaining/VBG regulation/NN ./. 
In/IN many/JJ communities/NNS ,/, anti-growth/JJ sentiment/NN coupled/VBN with/IN antipathy/NN to/TO automobiles/NNS has/VBZ discouraged/VBN the/DT construction/NN of/IN new/JJ or/CC expanded/VBN highways/NNS ./. 
The/DT result/NN has/VBZ been/VBN increased/VBN congestion/NN and/CC delays/NNS ./. 
But/CC this/DT is/VBZ a/DT local/JJ challenge/NN ,/, not/RB a/DT national/JJ one/CD ./. 
The/DT federal/JJ government/NN should/MD not/RB attempt/VB to/TO allocate/VB traffic/NN between/IN modes/NNS or/CC to/TO ``/`` promote/VB diversions/NNS of/IN commodity/NN movements/NNS to/TO underused/VBN facilities/NNS ./.

According/VBG to/TO this/DT view/NN ,/, depreciation/NN raises/VBZ the/DT dollar/NN price/NN of/IN goods/NNS and/CC therefore/RB the/DT prices/NNS paid/VBN by/IN U.S./NP citizens/NNS ./. 
The/DT consequence/NN is/VBZ inflation/NN ./.

As/IN well/RB ,/, a/DT falling/VBG exchange/NN rate/NN can/MD raise/VB import/NN prices/NNS by/IN inducing/VBG foreign/JJ suppliers/NNS to/TO cut/VB back/RP shipments/NNS of/IN goods/NNS to/TO the/DT U.S/NP ./.

And/CC one/CD key/NN condition/NN is/VBZ the/DT relative/JJ price/NN level/NN ./. 
In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, it/PP may/MD be/VB that/DT inflation/NN does/VBZ n't/RB go/VB up/RB because/IN the/DT dollar/NN is/VBZ going/VBG down/RB --/: the/DT dollar/NN goes/VBZ down/RB because/IN inflation/NN is/VBZ going/VBG up/RB ./. 
Exchange-rate/JJ movements/NNS may/MD also/RB reflect/VB differences/NNS in/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN general/JJ economic/JJ activity/NN ./. 
Because/IN increased/VBN demand/NN for/IN imported/VBN goods/NNS is/VBZ often/RB associated/VBN with/IN a/DT growing/VBG economy/NN ,/, countries/NNS experiencing/VBG faster/JJR growth/NN may/MD also/RB find/VB their/PP$ currency/NN is/VBZ depreciating/VBG in/IN foreign/JJ markets/NNS ./.

So/RB ,/, contrary/JJ to/TO some/DT currently/RB popular/JJ notions/NNS ,/, a/DT sinking/JJ dollar/NN may/MD be/VB the/DT consequence/NN of/IN a/DT booming/JJ economy/NN ./. 
In/IN that/DT case/NN ,/, a/DT falling/JJ dollar/NN could/MD be/VB non-inflationary/JJ ./. 
Additionally/RB ,/, movements/NNS in/IN exchange/NN rates/NNS can/MD also/RB be/VB caused/VBN by/IN divergent/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS ./.

Pounds/NNS will/MD come/VB into/IN more/JJR demand/NN from/IN bond/NN purchasers/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT dollar/NN will/MD therefore/RB fall/VB against/IN the/DT pound/NN ./. 
Because/IN faster/JJR monetary/JJ growth/NN can/MD cause/VB faster/JJR economic/JJ growth/NN and/CC lower/JJR nominal/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS ,/, it/PP can/MD cause/VB the/DT dollar/NN to/TO fall/VB ./. 
But/CC an/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT growth/NN rate/NN of/IN the/DT money/NN supply/NN also/RB ultimately/RB leads/VBZ to/TO heightened/JJ inflation/NN ./. 
In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, the/DT decline/NN in/IN the/DT value/NN of/IN the/DT dollar/NN and/CC the/DT increase/NN in/IN inflation/NN are/VBP both/DT manifestations/NNS of/IN the/DT same/JJ thing/NN --/: the/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT growth/NN of/IN the/DT money/NN supply/NN ./.

Because/IN the/DT RTZ/NP unit/NN does/VBZ almost/RB as/IN much/JJ business/NN in/IN Britain/NP as/IN in/IN the/DT U.S./NP ,/, Rhone-Poulenc/NP 's/POS British/JJ business/NN also/RB will/MD mount/VB ,/, to/TO 8/CD %/NN of/IN total/JJ sales/NNS from/IN 4/CD %/NN before/IN the/DT acquisitions/NNS ./.

In/IN a/DT few/JJ months/NNS ,/, the/DT government/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO broadly/RB reorganize/VB France/NP 's/POS chemical/JJ business/NN ,/, merging/VBG companies/NNS into/IN two/CD or/CC three/CD main/JJ groups/NNS ,/, with/IN Rhone-Poulenc/NP as/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT major/JJ poles/NNS ./. 
But/CC Mr./NP Fourtou/NP insisted/VBD that/IN the/DT restructuring/NN plans/NNS had/VBD n't/RB played/VBN a/DT role/NN in/IN his/PP$ decision/NN ./. 
Curiously/RB ,/, RTZ/NP and/CC Rhone-Poulenc/NP disagreed/VBD on/IN the/DT price/NN Rhone-Poulenc/NP is/VBZ paying/VBG for/IN the/DT RTZ/NP subsidiary/NN ./.

Rhone-Poulenc/NP ,/, however/RB ,/, said/VBD the/DT true/JJ price/NN is/VBZ the/DT #/# 512/CD million/CD it/PP will/MD pay/VB in/IN cash/NN ./. 
It/PP said/VBD the/DT debt/NN should/MD n't/RB be/VB considered/VBN part/NN of/IN the/DT price/NN ./. 
And/CC it/PP said/VBD the/DT price-earnings/JJ ratio/NN should/MD be/VB 12/CD rather/RB than/IN 24/CD ,/, because/IN it/PP should/MD be/VB calculated/VBN on/IN expected/VBN pretax/NN operating/VBG earnings/NNS for/IN this/DT year/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN last/JJ year/NN 's/POS actual/JJ net/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD affected/VBN by/IN other/JJ operations/NNS within/IN the/DT RTZ/NP group/NN ./. 
The/DT controversy/NN drew/VBD chuckles/NNS from/IN London/NP analysts/NNS ,/, who/WP said/VBD each/DT side/NN was/VBD exaggerating/VBG the/DT benefits/NNS it/PP was/VBD getting/VBG ./. 
Regardless/RB of/IN the/DT dispute/NN ,/, the/DT analysts/NNS said/VBD both/DT sides/NNS seemed/VBD likely/JJ to/TO benefit/VB from/IN the/DT sale/NN ./.

The/DT sale/NN helps/VBZ replenish/VB RTZ/NP 's/POS warchest/NN ,/, and/CC some/DT analysts/NNS thought/VBD it/PP could/MD set/VB the/DT stage/NN for/IN the/DT acquisitive/JJ mining/NN giant/NN to/TO resume/VB hunting/VBG for/IN new/JJ purchases/NNS ./. 
Though/IN a/DT fast-growing/JJ business/NN ,/, RTZ/NP Chemicals/NPS went/VBD on/IN the/DT auction/NN block/NN this/DT year/NN partly/RB to/TO help/VB pay/VB for/IN one/NN of/IN RTZ/NP 's/POS biggest-ever/JJ buys/NNS :/: This/DT year/NN 's/POS $/$ 4.4/CD billion/CD acquisition/NN of/IN British/NP Petroleum/NP Co./NP 's/POS minerals/NNS division/NN ./.

The/DT reason/NN for/IN that/DT ,/, Mr./NP Fourtou/NP said/VBD ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT unit/NN is/VBZ restructuring/VBG and/CC closing/VBG factories/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, big/JJ U.S./NP banks/NNS have/VBP maintained/VBN that/IN their/PP$ developing-country/JJ debt/NN reserves/NNS ,/, which/WDT generally/RB were/VBD under/IN 30/CD %/NN ,/, were/VBD adequate/JJ ./. 
However/RB ,/, the/DT debt/NN question/NN has/VBZ continued/VBN to/TO drag/VB down/RP stock/NN prices/NNS of/IN major/JJ banks/NNS ./. 
Mr./NP Butcher/NP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` One/CD of/IN the/DT difficulties/NNS of/IN this/DT issue/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PP 's/VBZ just/RB not/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN economics/NN ,/, it/PP 's/VBZ a/DT matter/NN of/IN politics/NN ./.

That/DT accord/NN allows/VBZ banks/NNS three/CD options/NNS on/IN their/PP$ debt/NN :/: to/TO make/VB new/JJ loans/NNS over/IN the/DT next/JJ four/CD years/NNS totaling/VBG 25/CD %/NN of/IN their/PP$ current/JJ exposure/NN and/CC take/VB no/DT charge/NN against/IN reserves/NNS ,/, or/CC to/TO swap/VB their/PP$ loans/NNS for/IN bonds/NNS that/WDT carry/VBP either/CC a/DT 35/CD %/NN discount/NN in/IN face/NN value/NN from/IN the/DT loan/NN amount/NN or/CC a/DT 6.25/CD %/NN interest/NN rate/NN ./.

{/( An/DT Occasional/NP Look/NP at/IN Investing/NP Fundamentals/NPS }/) When/WRB it/PP comes/VBZ to/TO building/VBG an/DT investment/NN portfolio/NN ,/, there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT crucial/JJ distinction/NN between/IN true/JJ diversification/NN and/CC simply/RB holding/VBG a/DT hodgepodge/NN of/IN securities/NNS ./. 
An/DT investor/NN could/MD hold/VB dozens/NNS of/IN small-company/NN stocks/NNS ,/, for/IN instance/NN ,/, and/CC still/RB be/VB ravaged/VBN by/IN the/DT special/JJ perils/NNS that/WDT affect/VBP this/DT volatile/JJ sector/NN ./.

The/DT real/JJ secret/NN of/IN portfolio/NN diversification/NN ,/, investment/NN professionals/NNS say/VBP ,/, is/VBZ to/TO mix/VB investments/NNS that/WDT do/VBP n't/RB move/VB in/IN tandem/NN --/: then/RB regularly/RB readjust/VB the/DT mix/NN to/TO maintain/VB its/PP$ original/JJ proportions/NNS ./.

But/CC diversification/NN is/VBZ n't/RB just/RB a/DT one-time/JJ exercise/NN that/IN investors/NNS can/MD do/VB and/CC then/RB forget/VB ./. 
Because/IN the/DT investments/NNS that/WDT perform/VBP best/RB in/IN a/DT given/VBN period/NN will/MD be/VB a/DT growing/VBG part/NN of/IN the/DT portfolio/NN ,/, while/IN those/DT that/WDT do/VBP poorly/RB will/MD represent/VB a/DT declining/VBG share/NN ,/, the/DT original/JJ mix/NN of/IN investments/NNS will/MD be/VB thrown/VBN off/IN balance/NN ./.

To/TO illustrate/VB his/PP$ point/NN ,/, Mr./NP Fogler/NP takes/VBZ two/CD theoretical/JJ investments/NNS :/: one/CD that/WDT gains/VBZ 100/CD %/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ year/NN and/CC falls/VBZ 50/CD %/NN in/IN the/DT second/JJ year/NN ,/, and/CC another/DT that/WDT falls/VBZ 50/CD %/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ year/NN and/CC rebounds/VBZ 100/CD %/NN the/DT second/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT same/JJ 16-year/JJ period/NN ,/, allowing/VBG for/IN a/DT two/CD year/NN delay/NN ,/, each/DT 1/CD %/NN rise/NN in/IN the/DT dollar/NN corresponds/VBZ to/TO an/DT extra/JJ 1/CD %/NN cumulative/JJ stock-price/NN appreciation/NN ./.

A/DT rising/VBG dollar/NN is/VBZ bearish/JJ for/IN earnings/NNS ,/, but/CC bullish/JJ for/IN the/DT market/NN ./. 
The/DT key/NN to/TO unlocking/VBG this/DT mystery/NN is/VBZ inflation/NN ./. 
Similar/JJ analysis/NN of/IN the/DT link/NN between/IN the/DT dollar/NN 's/POS value/NN and/CC U.S./NP inflation/NN illustrates/VBZ quite/RB clearly/RB that/IN a/DT rising/VBG currency/NN is/VBZ associated/VBN with/IN lower/JJR inflation/NN ./. 
Enter/VB the/DT accounting/NN system/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB inflation/NN neutral/JJ ,/, creating/VBG at/IN least/JJS two/CD possibilities/NNS for/IN fictitious/JJ profits/NNS and/CC losses/NNS ./.

The/DT more/JJR inflation/NN ,/, the/DT faster/JJR fictitious/JJ profits/NNS pile/VBP up/IN ./. 
A/DT weak/JJ dollar/NN ,/, by/IN exacerbating/VBG inflation/NN ,/, appears/VBZ to/TO bolster/VB the/DT growth/NN of/IN profits/NNS ./.

The/DT good/JJ news/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT Commerce/NP Department/NP provides/VBZ adjustments/NNS that/WDT can/MD minimize/VB this/DT illusory/JJ ,/, inflation-induced/JJ distortion/NN ./. 
The/DT bad/JJ news/NN is/VBZ that/IN most/JJS Wall/NP Street/NP sources/NNS do/VBP not/RB ./. 
Eliminating/VBG the/DT gap/NN for/IN the/DT Standard/NP &/CC Poor/NP 's/POS figures/NNS requires/VBZ crudely/RB adjusting/VBG them/PP using/VBG the/DT Commerce/NP Department/NP 's/POS data/NNS ./. 
The/DT resulting/VBG measure/NN approximates/VBZ S&P/NP earnings/NNS on/IN what/WP is/VBZ sometimes/RB called/VBN a/DT ``/`` quality/NN adjusted/VBN ''/'' basis/NN ./. 
This/DT change/NN in/IN accounting/VBG method/NN enables/VBZ the/DT paradox/NN to/TO be/VB resolved/VBN ./. 
Repeating/VBG the/DT calculation/NN ,/, a/DT 1/CD %/NN higher/JJR value/NN of/IN the/DT dollar/NN corresponds/VBZ to/TO a/DT 1/CD %/NN extra/JJ increase/NN in/IN quality-adjusted/JJ profits/NNS ./. 
In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, while/IN the/DT quantity/NN of/IN reported/VBN profits/NNS may/MD grow/VB more/RBR slowly/RB ,/, their/PP$ quality/NN increases/VBZ by/IN more/RBR than/IN enough/RB to/TO offset/VB the/DT damage/NN ./. 
A/DT strong/JJ dollar/NN is/VBZ a/DT bullish/JJ signal/NN for/IN both/PDT the/DT stock/NN market/NN and/CC adjusted/VBN profits/NNS ./. 
By/IN implication/NN the/DT adjusted/VBN price-earnings/NN ratio/NN hardly/RB moves/VBZ ./.

''/'' This/DT revolution/NN is/VBZ not/RB happening/VBG because/IN someone/NN decreed/VBD a/DT new/JJ ``/`` industrial/JJ policy/NN ''/'' from/IN Washington/NP ,/, but/CC rather/RB because/IN of/IN major/JJ changes/NNS taking/VBG place/NN in/IN the/DT capital/NN markets/NNS themselves/PP ./.

''/'' Stock/NN trading/NN is/VBZ essentially/RB a/DT zero-sum/JJ game/NN for/IN big/JJ funds/NNS since/IN ,/, on/IN average/NN ,/, their/PP$ managers/NNS can/MD never/RB beat/VB the/DT market/NN itself/PP ./.

Prof./NP Jensen/NP notes/VBZ that/IN private/JJ placements/NNS of/IN debt/NN and/CC equity/NN have/VBP risen/VBN more/RBR than/IN tenfold/RB since/IN 1980/CD and/CC now/RB account/VBP for/IN more/JJR than/IN 40/CD %/NN of/IN annual/JJ corporate/JJ financings/NNS ./.

Prof./NP Jensen/NP does/VBZ n't/RB think/VB that/IN the/DT privatization/NN trend/NN will/MD be/VB universal/JJ ./.

``/`` Buying/VBG value/NN mutual/JJ funds/NNS makes/VBZ sense/NN now/RB if/IN you/PP are/VBP nervous/JJ about/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Donald/NP Phillips/NP ,/, editor/NN of/IN Mutual/NP Fund/NP Values/NPS ,/, a/DT Chicago/NP publication/NN that/WDT tracks/VBZ mutual/JJ funds/NNS ./.
